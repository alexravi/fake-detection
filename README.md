# Fake Detection

This repository contains a collection of tools and resources for detecting fake content, particularly in the context of online media. The goal of this project is to develop robust algorithms and methodologies to identify and classify fake information, including images, videos, and textual content.

## Introduction
With the rise of social media and the widespread availability of digital editing tools, it has become increasingly challenging to distinguish between genuine and manipulated media. Fake news, photoshopped images, and deepfake videos have the potential to spread misinformation and deceive people. The Fake Detection project aims to address this issue by providing a set of tools that can help identify and classify fake content.

## Features
This repository offers the following features:

### Image Manipulation Detection
The image manipulation detection tools analyze images and detect potential manipulations, such as cloning, splicing, or retouching. These tools employ various techniques, including pixel-level analysis, metadata examination, and deep learning-based approaches, to identify signs of image tampering.

### Video Forgery Detection
The video forgery detection techniques aim to identify tampering in videos. These tools analyze videos at the frame level, detecting anomalies, inconsistencies, or visual artifacts that may indicate video manipulation. Motion detection algorithms and deep learning models are utilized to highlight potential areas of tampering.

### Textual Content Analysis
The textual content analysis algorithms focus on analyzing and identifying fake or misleading information in text. These tools employ various techniques, such as sentiment analysis, fact-checking, natural language processing, and machine learning, to detect and flag suspicious or inaccurate textual content.

### Deep Learning Models
The repository includes pre-trained deep learning models and libraries that can be used for fake detection tasks. These models are trained on large datasets and can be applied to tasks such as image classification, object detection, and text classification, aiding in the identification of fake content.

## Installation
