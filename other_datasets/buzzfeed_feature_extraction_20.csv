"We?ve never seen anything like this before in the sport of NASCAR? There are many people thatdon believe in things that NASCAR does. But those are mostly things like penalties and rules on the track.It not often that we say anyone complain about how the sport treats and includes people, simply because everyone for the most part thinks NASCAR does a pretty swell job. But it looks likethere ONE person who disagrees. That one person is Terrance Cox III, a Georgia man who has operated Diversity Motorsports Racing as well created a group to protest against NASCAR, alleging that officials, teams and owners are unjust towards the minority community. This past Friday, Cox filed a $500 million race discrimination lawsuit against NASCAR and its race teams due to claims that the sanctioning body of NASCAR would never help him as he tried to make NASCAR more racially diverse. InCox complaint, he stated that ?potential sponsors were encouraged by NASCAR to not work with him but instead go for drivers like Tony Stewart and Dale Jr.? They also allegedly refused to promote different programs that Cox created in order to make NASCAR more diverse. Lastly, Cox is claiming that NASCAR has ?engaged in unlawful intentional racial discrimination by refusing to sanction African-American owned racing teams ? and by refusing to hire African-American drivers for its racing teams.? Has NASCAR responded to this? HELL YEAH!They released a statement defending their Drive for Diversity program and have let Cox and everyone know that they are going to fight this lawsuit. ?NASCAR embraces all individuals interested and involved in our sport, whether as partners, fans, competitors or employees, and there is no merit to this lawsuit. NASCAR has a long-standing history of investing in diversity efforts including the NASCAR Drive for Diversity, NASCAR Diversity Internship and NASCAR Diversity Pit Crew Development programs. ? We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission. NASCAR not only will defend our organization against these meritless allegations, but we will be asserting our own claims against Mr. Cox for his defamatory actions. We established these [diversity] programs to create opportunities for women and minorities, and embrace people of all backgrounds, within the industry. Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders.?

"This is hot off the presses folks ? something dangerous is going on in the New York City metro area. At around 12:40 AM Monday morning police were alerted to a suspicious backpack near a trashcan in an Elizabeth, New Jersey trashcan. The men who reported it said they could see a pipe and wires sticking out of the bag. When police arrived they discovered FIVE different devices but when a bomb squad robot approached the bag one of the devices exploded, fortunately no one was injured. UPDATE: Elizabeth, NJ mayor says five devices found in bag near train station. One exploded while bomb squad robot tried to disarm it ? Fox News (@FoxNews) September 19, 2016 The latest bomb scare comes just one day after two other bombs exploded (one in Seaside Park, New Jersey and one in Manhattan) and three more were found by authorities before they could be detonated. Late Sunday evening authorities announced that they believed all five bombs from Saturday were the work of the same people, then later in the night they announced that they had made five arrests in connection with the bombs. Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a ?vehicle of interest? in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a ?number of individuals? who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that at least 5 men were being questioned. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about an ongoing investigation. The FBI said in a statement that no one had been charged with any crime and the investigation was ongoing. There is no word yet if the latest group of bombs found in Elizabeth, are connected to the just detained persons of interest. Elizabeth, New Jersey Mayor, Christian Bollwage speaking to the media about the bomb (you can see more video from the scene here): UPDATE: The man sought in connection with the bombings in Manhattan and Seaside Park, New Jersey has been captured after a shootout with police.

NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) September 19, 2016 Ahmad Khan Rahami is a Muslim man of Afghani origin who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey (the city where the bombs were found late last night/early this morning). Authorities had launched a dragnet earlier Monday in search of the 28-year-old Afghan-born man, whom they described as being ?armed and dangerous? A naturalized U.S. citizen, Rahami was wanted for questioning regarding the Saturday night blast in NewYork Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in NewJersey Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ. An eyewitness toRahami capture in Linden, NJ told Fox News that he saw a man walking down a street with a gun in his hand. A police car pulled up next to him and the man fired at cops 4-6 times. The shooter then began running down the street with several police cars trailing him, the witness, Peter Bilinskas, said. After days of pretending that the bombings were not the work of Islamic terrorists it seems that NewYork liberals are finally beginning to understand the truth. If a bomb goes off on American soil, it is more likely than not the work of Muslim terrorists. ?Today I believewe going to find out that [the bombing] was influenced by foreign sources,? Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday on ?Fox & Friends.?

"Adam Walinsky once worked for President John F. Kennedy. He wrote speeches for Bobby (RFK) Kennedy, and Bill Clinton once worked on his National Committee for the Police Corps. He is a longtime Democrat operative, politician, and leader, and in a recent article for Politico, Walinsky shocked the nation when he announced that he would be voting for Donald Trump on November 8th. I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. The question many are asking today is, why? Why would a long-time and highly respected Democrat defect at such a crucial time in our history? Why would Walinsky abandon the most establishment-friendly candidate in recent memory, to vote for a Republican outsider who eschews much of the Democrat Party platform. So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Walinsky focused on one key aspect of the campaign ? foreign policy: Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. Buttoday Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. Walinsky hammers one key area oftoday Democrat Party that many libertarians and some conservatives have decried for years. The Democrat Party is the party of hypocrisy when it comes to war and foreign policy. The very same people who for years marched against war during the Bush administration, have fallen silent during the Obama years. This reality is stunning, considering that President Obama has led us through 8 years of constant warfare (numbers below accurate as of May 2016): ?2,499 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq so far under President Obama, according to the independent Iraq Coalition Casualty Count. ?Of those, 1,906 have been killed in and around Afghanistan, and 593 in Iraq. ?Under Obama, the United States has been at war for 2,687 days.That longer than under George W. Bush ? or any other U.S. president, for that matter. ?Obama has conducted airstrikes on seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. (That?s three more countries than George W. Bush bombed.) ?U.S. combat forces are deployed on the ground in three countries: Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.That one more war than Obama inherited, and which his successor will likely have to contend with. Because of these truths and the reality that much ofObama foreign policy vision was crafted, developed, and carried out by Hillary Clinton, have led Walinsky to the realization that Donald Trump may be the most likely candidate to bring peace to our nation. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election? Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, ?America first.? But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. I urge you to read all ofWalinsky well-crafted argument in support of Donald Trump. He delivers paragraphs of excoriating commentary against the Democrat Party, while explaining why, despite his faults, Donald Trump may indeed be the man for this moment. If you believe America is starved for change, and many voters do, then the only candidate who offers any hope of real change is Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton not only represents ?more of the same? from Washington, D.C., she is the progenitor, and an ardent supporter of many of our worst, most ineffective policies, ideas, and plans. Voting against Clintondoesn only mean voting for change; it means voting against some of our worst political failures of the last 30 years.

"Story highlights The FBI's latest batch of data show a 3.9% year-over-year increase in violent crime The FBI noted that's still down over five-year and 10-year periods (CNN) Last year saw an increase in violent crime -- including murder -- compared to 2014, according to new data released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday. The annual findings showed an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes, up 3.9% from 2014, while the murder rate spiked by 10.8% over the same span. Those crimes include ""murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault,"" the FBI's website said. But the report indicated that violent crime is still below 2006 and 2011 levels for 10-year and five-year comparisons. The numbers are somewhat expected, reflecting both anecdotal and statistical evidence of an increase in violence since last October. That trend has been visible in several large cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Washington. Other major cities such as New York and Los Angeles have not experienced the same. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the data show ""we still have so much work to do,"" but stressed the overall numbers are down compared to several years ago.

"Washington  Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday. A four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll . Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%. The poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. Despite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc. On the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%). A new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point.

"Former President Bill Clinton slowly walked toward the podium, newly repositioned at the center of the stage under the spotlight. He diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the Clinton Global Initiative one final time. ?It?s been one of the great honors of my life,? Clinton said as he addressed crowd. ?You are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows. Now, I have spent the last 15 years of my life working to advance that idea.? WHAT TO KNOW President Clinton slowly walked toward the podium, newly repositioned at the center of the stage under the spotlight. He diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the Clinton Global Initiative one final time. The former president stood in front of his longtime friends, many them world dignitaries and leaders of NGOs, and also in front of his Clinton Foundation staff. He meticulously laid out a detailed history of his foundation. According to Clinton Foundation staff, the formerpresident nostalgic play-by-play in some part served as his defense to repeated criticism plaguing the Clinton Foundation during the presidential election cycle. Emails released by the State Department show that some Clinton Foundation donors received meetings with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which prompted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to accuse the Clinton Foundation of being a ?pay for play? organization. But Bill Clinton today shied away from engaging in the politics surrounding his foundation and instead used his platform as an attempt to change the negative narrative that has been seen as a liability to hiswife presidential bid. Clinton proudly recalled trips around the world, partnering with governments, corporations and influential people to deliver HIV/AIDS medication, fight childhood obesity and provide homes for Haitian families following the devastating 2010 earthquake, among countless other initiatives. The CGI Annual Meeting runs at the same time at the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to attract world leaders who can only attend if they pledge to commit to a cause. ?Everybody who comes has to actually make a commitment to do something to make the world a better place. Wewon saythere a minimum dollar amount, wewon saythere a minimum time amount, but they got to do something,? explained the former president. And then he joked, ?And I thoughtwe about to have a meeting and nobody will come.? Attendance at the annual meeting has dragged a bit since Hillary Clinton announced her presidential bid, as some donors have tried to keep space between the Clinton Foundation and her run for president. In previous years, President Barack Obama has attended and presidential candidates on both sides have come, but not this year. But Bill Clinton did not allow the scrutiny to keep him from giving CGI members a charge to continue their work, even if it would be without him. ?Don't give up on what brought you here. You have done something good and noble and worthy andit all just beginning,? said the former president. ?If we embrace our common humanity over our interesting differences and get up tomorrow in knowing that just if we get caught trying and we do it with somebody else, chances are it will work out better than it ever dreamed.

"Story highlights ""There's been far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement,"" Pence said The governor reiterated his belief that it is a challenging time to be in law enforcement Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told a church group here Thursday that there is ""far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement"" during a conversation about faith. Pence was answering a question posed by Bishop John Brannon who asked about how Pence as vice president could personally unite the nation. Pence referenced recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, ""It's a very troubling time for us."" The Charlotte shootings, which led to violence and unrest in that city this week, have sparked discussions of lethal police force against African-Americans. Pence mentioned faith as his first means to reunite the country and reduce violence, but then said he thought there was too much talk of how law enforcement officers conduct themselves.

"In this final stretch before Election Day, the Clinton camp is setting its sights on the youth. Interested in Hillary Clinton? Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The Democratic presidential nominee today held a millennial-focused campaign event at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she made her pitch to the voting bloc that has been unwilling to fully rally behind her. ""Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that,"" Clinton, in a moment of self-reflection, told the crowd of 300 people. ""And I want to do my best to answer those questions.? She explained that the servicepart of ?public service? has always been easier for her than the publicpart. ?I will never be the showman my opponent is and, you know what, that's OK with me,? she said, referring to Donald Trump. Over the past week, the Clinton campaign has redoubled its efforts to attract millennials, whom demographers define loosely as people born in the early-1980s through the early-2000s. Clinton surrogates President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all been tapped to hit the trail. The main focus: urging young people to vote. ?We need everyone off the sidelines,? Clinton said today. ?Not voting is not an option. That just plays intoTrump hands, it really does.? Clinton, who started her remarks calling on the country to ?remain vigilant? in the wake of the bombings in New York and New Jersey, also used the opportunity to contrast herself with her Republican opponent. ""You want something to vote for, not just against,"" she told the crowd. ?Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. ?You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality-TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name calling or stunts to get on the cable news,? she added, referencingTrump long-held and false belief that Obama was born outside the United States. ?This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America,? she concluded. Trump has since said that he believes Obama was born in the United States. Although Clinton is polling better with young adults than Trump (a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that she has 40 percent support among youth versusTrump 28 percent), the demographic, as a whole, has shown less enthusiasm for her candidacy than other Democrats. According to that same poll, 60 percent of Democratic adults under the age of 30 said they had hoped Sanders would win theirparty nomination, while 26 percent said Clinton. That number, however, is better than it was four months ago. (During the primary in spring, 75 percent of Democrats under the age of 30 supported Sanders, while only 25 percent said they supported Clinton, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.) Clinton campaign officials, who hope to close that gap further, say they plan to continue these outreach efforts throughout the rest of the campaign. ""The millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election and it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,? Clinton spokesman Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement today. ?That is why the campaign has recently ramped up efforts to engage millennial voters through a stretch of events with surrogates like President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Senator Tim Kaine, Anne Holton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. ?The campaign has also brought on board staff at headquarters and in states to organize and mobilize millennial voters,? she added. ?And over the coming weeks, the campaign will continue to host discussions in communities on how Hillary Clinton is fighting for them.?

"It was a busy weekend for miscreant Islamist scum operating under the imprimatur of the international socialist-Islamist axis within America. On Saturday, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a New Jersey resident and naturalized immigrant from Afghanistan, detonated multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. No one was killed, but nearly 30 people were injured. Rahami was apprehended three days later in Linden, New Jersey, after a gun battle with police. Also on Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir Adan, a Somali Muslim who had been living in the United States for the past 15 years, stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson, Adan ?who was disguised as a security guard at the time of the attacks ? ?reportedly made references to Allah during the attack and asked at least one person whether they were Muslim.? Dahir was killed by police at the scene. According to the New York Times, Rahami, the man arrested for the New York and New Jersey bombings, became a ?completely different person? after a trip to Afghanistan, when it is presumed he became ?radicalized,? a term used by the press and politicos to describe a Muslim who crosses that obscure line from Islamic to militant Islamist. It has also been reported that Rahami made several other trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan without being detected by the U.S. government.Rahami father, Mohammed Rahami, told the press this week that he had reported his son to the FBI as a potential terrorist in 2014, but the agency took no action. While the Rahami and Adan stories have received wide press coverage, of course we are still being subjected to the usual spin and politically correct propaganda from the press and politicians, which deftly avoids the motive attendant to these attacks ? this being that the perpetrators were Muslims and were acting based on Islamic doctrine. At this point,we now seen several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism perpetrated by Muslims wherein communities and law enforcement agencies were previously made aware of the danger posed by these individuals. In all of these cases, nothing was done to mitigate the potential danger. In the case of federal law enforcement, to some extent it stands to reason that organizations such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security might be less motivated to counter these threats, since these are under the control of the Obama administration, whose agenda includes destabilizing America through an influx of potentially violent Muslims and the establishment of insular Muslim communities. In a speech to the United Nations this week, our bath house refugee-playing statesman president, Barack Hussein Obama, defended increasing globalization and condemned the populist nationalism that has been growing in the West in direct response to the actions of murderous Muslim ?migr?s and refugees. This deportment, which has included the Obama administration illegally facilitating the importation of tens of thousands of Muslims from unstable, culturally bankrupt Islamic nations, has also given rise to such debacles as the 858 people who, according to a new Department of Homeland Security inspectorgeneral report, were mistakenlygranted citizenship due to a failure of the federalgovernment fingerprint records system, despite having been ordered deported. This is eerily reminiscent of the jihadi training camps known to exist across the continental U.S., but which law enforcement is prohibited from engaging because the Islamist groups operating them somewhat conveniently did not make it onto the federalgovernment official list of terrorist organizations. Tragically, this international socialist-Islamist axis of Western elites even includes powerful religious leaders such as Pope Francis, who regularly condemns ?hateful acts of terrorism? with one breath while admonishing Europeans to ?welcome refugees into your homes and communities? (the same refugees who are rioting and raping their way across that continent) with the next. With regard to the United States, this is a component of the agenda calculated to render America irrelevant as a nation of influence on the world stage. The Islamists seek global supremacy for their foul doctrine, while the socialists harbor attitudes varying from those which hold that the concept of nations itself is outmoded, to those which characterize the U.S. as last among the old-school imperialist oppressor nations that must be dismantled. A chief stratagem of the latter is of course the idea that racism practiced by those of northern European descent has been the greatest evil of the last thousand years. ErikRush book on race is bold, daring and needed ? now more than ever: ?Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal ?America Racial Obsession? ? just $4.95!It a pretty safe bet that the conservative establishment press will have no interest in that upon which your humble commentator has to say regarding these matters from this point forward, since I would start with a moratorium on Muslim immigration and the summary expulsion of each and every Muslim foreign national in the United States. I would also revoke the citizenship of each and every naturalized Muslim American and deport them to their native countries, save for giving them the opportunity to renounce Islam in order to escape this fate. These people, as well as the second and third-generation descendants of Muslim ?migr?s, could count on ongoing surveillance to ensure their sincerity. Here, obviously, I am dispensing with the subverted notions of constitutionality popularly advanced by the left, as well as political correctness and cultural relativism. Islam is not a religion, nor should it be considered such under law; it is a retrograde system ascribed to by barbarians whose company I would typically pass on in favor of an afternoon cavorting with a troupe of lower primates.

Sunlight Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is funded through donations. ?It became increasingly harder to fund and maintain all of these different things,? the spokesperson said, referring to the various tools Sunlight Foundation has built over the years, tracking everything from deleted tweets of politicians to political fundraising. Another factor was theorganization inability to find a permanent executive director with a vision for theorganization future, Klein wrote. Sunlight Foundation co-founder, Ellen Miller, stepped down from her role as executive director in 2014, and the organization struggled to retain upper management since then. ?The board has not found a candidate for executive director who persuaded us of both a compelling new strategic vision and of their capacity to lead Sunlight to its achievement,? Klein wrote. ?Accordingly, we have determined to explore alliances with other organizations similarly motivated, perhaps merging with one of them, in an arrangement that advances and preservesSunlight mission and identity with increased efficiency and effectiveness.? The hope is that SunlightFoundation work can live on and be built upon at likeminded organizations devoted to government transparency and campaign finance. Those possible partnerships ? or a potential merger with another organization, which Klein said the organization was exploring ? will play a role in the fate of the employees at the nonprofit. Those potential partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. For the time being, Sunlight Foundation hopes to continue scaled-back operations for as long as possible.",0.040865385,0,0,0.014423077,0.060096154,0.175480769,0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights A top aide to John Kasich slammed the chair of the Republican Party in a statement late Sunday RNC Chair Reince Priebus had warned of consequences for not backing nominee (CNN) A top aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich criticized Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus after the party chairman warned of consequences for former presidential candidates like Kasich who've refused to back Donald Trump for president, despite signing loyalty pledges during the primary. ""The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does,"" said John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist. ""He will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Weaver was responding to Priebus' appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. During that interview, the RNC chairman suggested that GOP presidential candidates who'd signed pledges to back the eventual Republican nominee during the 2016 primary, but who have since withheld support for Trump's candidacy, could be prevented from running for president again by the party. Kasich has repeatedly said he does not plan to endorse Trump. ""Those people need to get on board,"" Priebus said. ""And if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, I think that we're going to evaluate the process -- of the nomination process and I don't think it's going to be that easy for them."" ""People in our party are talking about what we're going to do about this. I mean there's a ballot access issue in South Carolina. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is,"" he explained. ""So what's the penalty for that? It's not a threat, but that's just the question that we have a process in place.""",0.039130435,0,0.008695652,0.017391304,0.082608696,0.230434783,0,2,-1,1
"Raleigh, North Carolina  As soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were quick to claim victory. But by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful. Just hours after Clinton and Trump clashed on stage at Hofstra University in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate. Clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high. The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. Before taking off to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a ""great, great"" evening ""One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Lets play two,'"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that."" And taking a dig at Trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a ""defective"" microphone, Clinton quipped: ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night."" And in fact, the Republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning. Calling into Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" early Tuesday, Trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate. His first target was NBC News' Lester Holt, the moderator of Monday night's debate. Just hours before, Trump had praised Holt in the spin room to CNN, saying the newscaster had done a ""great job"" and was ""very fair."" Those compliments were long gone. ""I had some hostile questions,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""He didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed. He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. There's no question about it."" Trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone. ""My microphone was terrible,"" Trump complained. ""I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?"" To top things off, Trump unloaded on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression. With no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, Trump once again went after Machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own. ""That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,"" Trump said. ""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem."" Those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. Late Monday, the Clinton campaign released a new video featuring Machado. ""He'd tell me, 'You look ugly,' or, 'You look fat,'"" Machado says in the video. ""Sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'Hello, Miss Piggy,' 'Hello, Miss Housekeeping.'"" Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton. She told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a ""really bad dream."" ""I never imagined in 20 years later I will be in this position,"" she said. ""Watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments."" Speaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, saying it was ""very clear that he didn't prepare."" ""What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,"" she said. ""It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter."" Marguerite Scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by Trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. Scott lso chastised the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado. ""Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business,"" Scott said. ""And to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is.""",0.038321168,0,0.001824818,0.012773723,0.074817518,0.306569343,0,2,-1,1
"With just 50 days until the election, Donald Trump is facing a staggering ? and perhaps historic ? organizational disadvantage. According to a POLITICO review of campaign spending, Hillary Clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on TV commercials as her Republican rival and has established twice as many field offices in many of the states that will decide who wins the presidency. In many battlegrounds, she has dozens more organizers than Trump. Story Continued Below While Trump, a first-time politician who has surrounded himself with advisers who are new to the rigors of presidential campaigns, has made serious headway in a number of battlegrounds in recent days, his on-the-ground and in-the-air deficits could be what stands between him and 270 electoral votes. ?We?re in completely untested waters,? said David Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican operative who is leading a study group at the Harvard Institute of Politics contrasting the traditional campaign approach adopted by Clinton with the non-traditional one being used by Trump. ?There has never been such a wide disparity in resource allocation as we're seeing in 2016.? The question, though, may be whetherTrump lack of infrastructure matters in an election cycle that has so far rewarded a low-budget approach built on free media and mass rallies rather than TV ads and door-knocking. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, sent an email to a group of top Trump advisers, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, TV ad maker Larry Weitzner, and senior communications adviser Jason Miller, briefing them on the latest in commercial spending. The numbers were startling. As of Sept. 12, the email noted, Trump had spent $17 million on TV ads, a small fraction of the $126 million Clinton had invested. When outside groups were added to the mix,Trump deficit was even greater -- $33 million toClinton $244 million. Trump aides say the figures reflect a simple reality: Their funds are limited. Through the end of July, Clinton and her outside group allies had raised a combined $435 million toTrump $160 million ? a difference of more than two-to-one, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Unlike Clinton, a powerful fundraiser, Trump has struggled to attract the support of deep-pocketed donors, many of whom have been repelled by his candidacy. Those working for pro-Trump super PACs are racing to find a solution. Advisers to one of the groups, Rebuilding America Now, are openly discussing the possibility that Rick Scott, the wealthy Florida governor who is chairing the super PAC, may soon provide it with a contribution. Clinton has used her TV barrage to cast her Republican opponent as a dangerous, unpredictable figurewho ill-suited suited to occupy the Oval Office. Last week, while Trump aired commercials in just four states, Clinton had spots running in nine battlegrounds. One Clinton ad that went into heavy rotation, titled ?Sacrifice,? spotlighted critical comments Trump made about Arizona Sen. JohnMcCain war record. Strategists from both parties say they cannot recall the last time a presidential nominee has been so dominated on the TV airwaves. The seven-to-one ratio confronting Trump far eclipses the five-to-four margin President Barack Obama faced in 2012 and the two-to-one ratio McCain encountered in 2008. With early voting in some battlegrounds opening in just days, the race is entering its most intense phase yet. And while Clinton has established formidable operations in many key states, Trump has far fewer full-time staffers to get out the vote, according to figures provided by campaign aides, national party officials, and swing-state operatives. In must-win Ohio, where early voting begins on Oct. 12, Clinton has around 250 organizers and 50 offices. Trump, meanwhile, has roughly 110 staffers and 30 offices. Republicans say Gov. JohnKasich persistent refusal to endorse Trump has hurt the nominee, depriving him of man-power. Many ofKasich longest-serving aides, including Jeffrey Polesovsky and Jai Chabria, have decided to sit on the sidelines. Chabria, a former Kasich senior adviser, said Trump was behind in a state where appealing to low-propensity voters was a weeks-long process thatcouldn be done overnight. ?It?s a very late effort by the Trump folks to play catch up, and the Democrats and the Clinton campaign have been here for a long time.That going to have an effect,? he said. ?Big rallies are really nice, but actual campaigns matter in Ohio.? In North Carolina, where Trump has around 170 staffers and 10 offices, Clinton has over 250 workers and 30 offices. Democrats say they are implementing a detailed plan aimed at intensifying turnout among black and college-educated voters, demographic groups that Trump has struggled with. Last month, Clinton brought aboard Dan Kanninen, who played a key role in BarackObama 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to help oversee her campaign in the state. In New Hampshire,it a similar story. While Trump has fewer than 50 full-time organizers and just a handful of offices, Clinton has around 100 staffers and 25 offices. ?Two months out, I think Hillary has a stronger operation than Trump up here.That pretty apparent from the number of staff, the number of offices, and the number commercials,? said Jim Merrill, a veteran Republican strategist who oversaw MarcoRubio primary bid in New Hampshire and held similar positions on MittRomney two presidential campaigns. ?Trump is behind where we were in 2012.? In even conservative bastions, Clinton is developing formidable infrastructure. In Arizona, Clinton has around 160 staffers and 25 offices, and in Georgia she has roughly 40 organizers and 10 offices. In that state, Tracey Lewis, who worked on Michelle Nunn's 2014 Georgia Senate bid, recently signed on as a senior advisor. Republicans declined to detail their numbers in the two conservative states but acknowledged that Clinton had a bigger field presence. While Trump advisers concedethey behind in the ground war, they insistthey making serious gains. The campaign, for example, said it had improved its footing in Florida after engineering a recent staff shuffle. State director Karen Giorno,who clashed with many members of the Trump team, was replaced with Susie Wiles, a former top adviser to Scott, the Florida governor. Yet in an electionthat so far been driven by daily headlines, some are wondering if textbook campaign metrics like TV ads and field staffers will matter as much as they have in previous years. Some are coming to the conclusion that the New Yorkbusinessman lack of swing-state infrastructure might not be fatal. Throughout his campaign, Trump has invested relatively little on TV ads and field deployment ? instead surviving off his ability to pack rallies and generate overwhelming media attention for speeches and statements large and small. On Thursday morning, during a meeting convened byTrump congressional supporters on Capitol Hill, Conway said the Republican nominee would give multiple addresses each week focusing on specific policieshe implement as president. ?The fact that the numbers have moved gradually inTrump favor in spite of the onslaught of spending by Hillary causes a lot of head-scratching,? said Kochel, who was chief strategist on JebBush presidential campaign. ?But the voters are getting their information in a thousand different ways outside of the campaigns? control.?",0.02247191,0.002247191,0.002247191,0.011235955,0.034831461,0.235955056,0.002247191,2,-1,1

" STrump number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in thecompany hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the FirstAmendment protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel andTrump campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. ?The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,? the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republicannominee most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant.Thiel parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but nowhe supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be HulkHogan secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing thebillionaire then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out theGOP bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, ?Every American has a unique identity.I proud to be gay,I proud to be a Republican,? after a lengthy rant against ?government incompetence.? He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own partydidn pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. ?Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,? said the Department ofLabor OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ?Ournation taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.? Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself vigorouslyand denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer ? the federal government ? of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that hiscompany hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

"Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too. Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies. Story Continued BelowIt standard practice for the agency ? which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials ? to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates. In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle. The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest. ?The taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying ?everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.? Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC ?specifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats? on charter aircraft. A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August,Trump campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower. But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc. Trump, who once said ?I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,? has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets. The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as ?misleading and flat out wrong,? pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign. The statement explained thecampaign payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying ?the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.? The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission. ""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses."" The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. Soit conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane. The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly. The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund. Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August,Trump campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.",0.021032505,0.001912046,0,0.009560229,0.036328872,0.244741874,0,2,-1,1

"Donald Trump is a creature of television. And as a creature of television, he holds strong opinions about what ought to happen when he steps in front of the cameras. For the 2016 presidential debates,he weighed in with a variety of programming suggestions: A debate schedule that does not conflict with NFL games. Different moderators. Or no moderators at all: ?I think that maybe we should just have no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate,? he mused onCNBC Squawkboxearlier this month. Radical and unlikely as this last idea may seem, it also raises a fascinating question: Why have moderators at all? Whydon we have debates where candidates just face off, one-on-one, without any questioners? Such a format could be a radical but useful break from the classic debate structures that have undergirded 50-plus years of presidential history. Story Continued Below Format shapes the outcome of debates far more than we realize. Some formats are relatively simple for candidates to maneuver, allowing strong candidates to game the system; others keep them more under control? Debates are certainly not ?rigged,? but a standard two-podium format typically favors a very information-dense candidate like Hillary Clinton, while a town-hall format gives much more room for a big personality, like Trump, to dominate. For voters, too, different formats provide different kinds of information, from character to geniality to areas of expertise. The format Monday night is an extremely open one, borrowed from an idea debuted in 2012. Even without heedingTrump recommendation, the rules of engagement for thisyear presidential debates grant the candidates the power to conduct an essentially moderator-less exchange if they really want, allowing one or the other to grab the reins and seize control. On the one hand, this format would seem to benefit a loose performer like Trump, who is fully at home in the rough-and-tumble of live TV. On the other, long open exchanges could give Clinton a showcase to demonstrate her superior knowledge of policy and government. It might seem like a play for advantage, butTrump proposal for a debate without moderators is merely the latest entry in a long-running political conversation that has been underway since Lincoln met Douglas: what is the best way to design and execute a live campaign debate?It a surprisingly unsettled question after all theseyears might be poised for some radical changes. *** As both campaigns prepare for the showdown on Monday night, they should study the first debate from 2012, when Mitt Romney handed Barack Obama the most conclusive drubbing in a presidential debate since Richard Nixon sweated his way to defeat in 1960. The 2012 debates featured an innovation which, at the time, went nearly unremarked-upon in the press: long, open-ended discussion periods that, in effect, left it to the candidates to decide how the dialogue would unfold. Romney prepared specifically for these ground rules and took full advantage on debate night; Obama did not. And though much criticism was directed at moderator Jim Lehrer for approaching his task too passively, in fact, it wasObama rigidity in a malleable format that produced such a lopsided result. This exact same format will be used on Monday, as well as in the third debate, on October 19. Clinton and Trump will square off in six thematic blocks of 15 minutes apiece on subjects announced by the moderator in advance: This year, the topics will include ?America?s Direction,? ?Achieving Prosperity? and ?Securing America.? Although the moderator is responsible for introducing topics and ensuring a more or less equal distribution of time, the debaters themselves determine how those 15-minute segments play out. As far back as 1960, debate producers had hoped to install a format that emphasized direct exchange between Kennedy andNixon so-called Oxford-styledebate campaign handlers vetoed the idea. What happened instead was three decades of a fairly rigid, controlled formula that often reduced the debatesto parallel news conferences. ?The panel's role was hardly more than to designatecategories, vegetable, ormineral which the two might or might not discourse,? complained one Kennedy-Nixon panelist afterward. Despite the limitations of journalistic panels, the format endured because it imbued the candidates with a sense ofsecurity kept them from having to confront each other directly. The first Carter-Ford debate in 1976, for instance, contained virtually no cross-talk by the candidates, who addressed each other only by talking to the moderators. Although change has come slowly to presidential debates, it has come. In 1988, for instance, moderators for the first time were allowed to ask an opening question. Everyone remembers BernardShaw hardball opening question to Michael Dukakis (?If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered??), but Shaw had a similarly gruesome set-up for George H.W. Bush (?If you are elected and die before Inauguration Day??). The introduction of town hall debates in 1992 wrought a wholly new format, one that has bedeviled candidates ever since. The town hall can generate positiveresults in 1992 and2004 it can be dull and un-insightful?as in 1996 and 2008. It can also encourage candidate aggression, as in the 2012 match between Obama and Romney. Whatever the outcome, town hall is probably the least comfortable format for politicians because it is nearly impossible to game in advance. For that reason, campaign negotiators have imposed increasingly burdensome restrictions over the years on how the town hall functions. The once-freewheeling format of 1992 has been reined in considerably, in the vain hope of protecting the participants. The 1990s also marked the debut of solo moderators in place of panels, giving individual journalists an outsized role in setting the debate agenda. Jim Lehrer filled that slot for every presidential debate in 1996 and 2000; since 2004, each debate has been helmed by a different moderator. Another recent format innovation is the table debate, in which candidates and moderator sit at a table instead of standing at lecterns. Table debates can be more conversational than the more formal setup of lectern debates. Furthermore, by placing the debaters in close proximity, table debatesencourage least intheory more civilized level of discourse. For Dick Cheney, table debates were also a practical necessity: withCheney history of heart problems, his advisers did not want to risk having him stand for 90 minutes. Whatwe going to see on Monday will be dramatic and is widely expected to be the most-watched debate in Americanhistory the format itself will be part of the reason why. Two drastically different personalities will, essentially, have six free-for-all segments to go at each other. The more polarized the electorate, the more valuable this kind of formatis diminishes the role of moderators and panels, who voters increasingly distrust, and gives the candidates the opportunity to guide the conversation. Similar formats have been successful in countries like France andSpain the U.S., too. During the 1992 Democratic primaries, Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown appeared on an episode of Donahue in which host Phil Donahue did little more than introduce his guests and let them have at it; the result was a fascinating and unpredictable hour of television. We should be so lucky to have a similar debate on Monday night. *** In the elections to come, strange new debate experiments are in the offing. Producers of primary debates have experimented with the use of crowd-sourced topics, including questions submitted as YouTube videos or via Twitter. This past summer, party leaders in Australia held one of their national debates not on broadcast and cable TV but on Facebook Live. Technological advances promise to inject new life into what many critics see as a sclerotic institution. At their best, these innovations might hold candidates accountable by tapping into real-time voter reactions and concerns. At worst, an excess of experimentation might reduce presidential debates to high-stakes video games. One novel proposal comes from New America senior fellow Lee Drutman, who suggests that we ought to end debates as we know them, and replace them with a crisis-situation simulator: ?Film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-TV special.? Perhaps the candidates can be administered the kobayashi maru; that, too, would receive high ratings. Still, without any of that high-tech sizzle, Monday night will be must-see TV for any voting-age American. It will simply be two candidates on a stage with one moderator, but likely to be more freewheeling thanwe imagine.

"Story highlights Heather Bresch is Manchin's daughter and the head of Mylan Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the drug Washington (CNN) Sen. Joe Manchin strongly defended his daughter, Heather Bresch, over growing criticism that her company dramatically raised prices for its life-saving medicine in order to enrich her company -- and herself. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the West Virginia Democrat broke his silence and sharply criticized lawmakers from both parties who have seized on the rising cost of EpiPen to bash his daughter's stewardship of her company, Mylan. He said lawmakers were trying to be ""sensational"" by seizing on Bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation. And he slammed an article in USA Today for questioning whether his wife, Gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a ""cheap shot"" and ""tabloid"" journalism. He praised Mylan as a West Virginia company that saved the country $180 billion. Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost.

It has nothing to do with a preemptive strike. Right. The fact that they follow the talking points from the Clinton staff is proof enough that they are in the bag for Hillary.

The New York Times started the chain reaction on Saturday: ?A Week of Whoppers? Then, the LA Times, Washington Post and Politico followed suit. As CNN media analyst Brian Stelter points out, the publications claim the timing was a coincidence: Several of the editors who were involved said the timing was a coincidence. But there was clearly a desire to publish stories beforeMonday debate, when Trump andClinton truthfulness will surely be at issue. ?Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has,? the L.A. Times declared on page one ofSunday paper. PoliticoMagazine team analyzed every statement made by both Trump and Clinton for five days and said ?the conclusion is inescapable:Trump mishandling of facts and propensity for exaggeration so greatly exceedClinton as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.?Stelter sources also claimed there was no coordination with the Clinton campaign: The four stories were welcomed by the Clinton campaign; aides cited the statistics in television interviews on Sunday. However, there is no indication that the Clinton campaign was involved. Marty Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post, said the timing of the stories was a coincidence. ?Wedon coordinate coverage with anyone else,? Baron said.

"The beginning of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump included statements that would have ended the campaign of any other politician. Has an announcement speech ever looked so much like a flashily produced political suicide? Did he really just call a key part of the electorate criminals and rapists? Ever since his blunt, racially divisive debut in Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump has proven that gaffes do not singe his hide like they do the fragile and fretful politicians who tiptoe through the typical campaign for public office. Time and again, Trump poured gasoline on himself and lit a match. Time and again, pundits predicted fatal self-immolation. Instead, Trump often rode the ensuing firestorm like an Atlas rocket. His poll numbers actually went up after he insulted JohnMcCain war record. What mainstream politician has ever said something like that, much less received a boost out of it? The only thing more stunning thanTrump dismantling of campaign norms has been how consistently he has flirted with disaster. Story Continued Below He has insulted brown people, black people, Muslim people, Jewish people. He has insulted women. He has insulted the grieving parents of a dead soldier. He has mocked a disabled person and expressed admiration for dictators. He has ham-handedly pandered to a politically critical portion of the population by posting to social media a picture of gringo Tex-Mex captioning it, ?I love hispanics!? He has suggested he could shoot somebody and not lose votes. He has openly talked about the possibility of the assassination of his opponent. Twice. And these are just the insults, not the demonstrable falsehoods.

Amid the pre-debate speculation that he could say something at the debate that would cost him the election,it difficult to imagine what he could say that would do what so many other statements of his were unable to and end his campaign. Here are 37 of his gaffes that could have beenfatal somehowweren. 1. ?When Mexico sends its people,they not sending their best.They not sending you.They not sending you.They sending people that have lots of problems, andthey bringing those problems with us.They bringing drugs.They bringing crime.They rapists.

"With the world watching, President Barack Obama today took an apparent swipe at Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, in his eighth and final address to the United Nations General Assembly as commander in chief. Interested in Barack Obama? Add Barack Obama as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Barack Obama news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest ""Today a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama warned, without naming the Republican presidential nominee. Obama further cautioning against ""the same forces of global integration"" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing ""deep fault lines in the existing international order"" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world. He made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the Zika virus that ""mosquitoes don't respect walls"" and saying of terrorism that ""the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies."" Though he never directly addressed the U.S. presidential election, Obama's message for the General Assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing ""a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now"" and an appeal for a top-down ""strongman model."" Obama rejected such tendencies. ""History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths,"" he said. ""Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war."" Speaking about the big picture, the Obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with Cuba. ""This is important work,"" he stressed. ""It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together."" Obama said nations ""can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration"" or ""retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion."" ""I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward,"" he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to ""acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction."" ""The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions ? economic, political and cultural ? that are caused by integration are squarely addressed."" Obama demanded that democracies of the world ""speak out forcefully"" for ""freedom and dignity."" ""A world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable,"" he said. ""These are the policies I've pursued in the United States, and with clear results"" ? touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education. His speech came as fighting in Syria has resumed after the Syrian military declared Monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the U.S. and Russia just over a week ago. ""Together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering,"" Obama said. ""There's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations ? particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography ? that can do more to offer a hand."" In the same month that North Korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, Obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization. ""We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict,"" he said. ""And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central plan to control the economy is a dead end,"" Obama said.",0.028625954,0,0.003816794,0.007633588,0.057251908,0.358778626,0.011450382,2,-1,1
"""I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved. The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said ? giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing PlannedParenthood partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants ? a provision that had been a major point of contention. Story Continued Below ?Senate Republicans stand ready to move forward,? McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. ?I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.? McConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week. But the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood ? particularly Profamilias, the health careprovider partner in Puerto Rico ? from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said. Language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landminethat delayed Zika aid for months. Despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said nowhen asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day. ?Close is relative,? Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach. For instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill. But Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested theywouldn accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package. ?Louisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,? Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. ?Theydon want to do Flint.? Another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obamaadministration proposal to hand over the U.S.government authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 ? a pushthat being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans ? even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats. ?This is the coordination of the domain names.It not who has control of the Internet,? Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. ?And every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.? Meanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million ? which ithasn been able to do because three of the five seats on thebank board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election. There are other items that could fill up theSenate legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. Though Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so. Republicans ? who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance ? privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.

"Gunfire and racially charged rioting have broken out again, this time in Charlotte, offering Donald Trump another chance to unabashedly sell himself as the ?law and order? candidate, to side with police over African-American protesters and to rally his overwhelmingly white base. But Trumphasn quite done that. Story Continued Below Instead, the Republican presidential nominee delivered a more muted response as he called into Fox News Thursday morning, saying ?there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black.? A day earlier, while campaigning in a black neighborhood in Cleveland, Trump defended an unarmed black man who was shot recently ? and questioned the actions of the police officer who shot him. After more than a year of running one of the most racially and ethnically divisive campaigns in decades, Trump has begun to zig and zag on issues of race in theelection final stretch. Appearing with black supporters and in black neighborhoods multiple times this month, Trump has sought to wash away the charges of racism that white nationalists have cheered. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has made casting Trump as outside-the-mainstream ? she hammered Trump on The Steve Harvey Show for ?bullying and bigotry? this week ? one of the cornerstones of her campaign.Trump advisers and the candidate himself insist his concerted black outreach is a genuine effort to chip away at Democrats? overwhelmingly margin among black voters, a group with whom he is polling in the low single digits. But Democrats, and even some skeptical Republicans, see his new tone more as an effort to make himself palatable to uneasy white voters who might otherwise be turned off by his past rhetoric. ?When he asks black voters, ?What have you got to lose, itcan get any worse,?he really just cynically talking to white voters,? said Rob Stutzman, a veteran Republican strategist and Trump critic. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said, ?I can't discern the intentions of Mr. Trump on this issue, but here's what we can say: Policy without particulars on the eve of the election insults the intelligence and sensitivities of any group.? Trump spoke most at length about the unfolding violence in Charlotte on Thursday at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, describing a ?very wounded country? and national leadership vacuum that he would fill. ?There is no right to engage in violent disruption,? Trump said, as Charlotte residents have taken to the streets in violent protest of the fatal shooting of a black man there. Police have fired back tear gas in intense clashes. He pitched his ?law and order? approach as beneficial to black communities. ?The people who will suffer most are law abiding African-American residents,? Trump said. That line was in his prepared remarks distributed by his campaign. But moments later, he ad-libbed a white stereotype of black communities. ?And ifyou not aware,? Trump said, deviating from his teleprompter. ?Drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.? These days, Trump regularly tells mostly white audiences about the travesty of black neighborhoods, comparing them to war-torn places like Afghanistan. In rural North Carolina on Tuesday, Trump said that African-American communities are ?absolutely in the worst shape thatthey ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.? On Wednesday, not long after his appearance with a Cleveland church where Trump questioned the police officer in Oklahoma who shot an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, Trump embraced a broad expansion ?stop-and-frisk,? a controversial policing policy. By Thursday, Trump said hewasn backing a national policy ? saying he was only referring to Chicago, despite making his comment in Cleveland. ""We've seen an expression of empathy for the loss of Mr. Crutcher's life, followed by a call for the nationalization and expansion of stop-and-frisk, preceded by a call for law and order without specifying what that means,? Brooks said. ?His platform suffers from a multiple personality disorder. It's not consistent.? Still, Trump has clearly made some efforts. In Pittsburgh, Trump preached empathy. ?We all have to walk a mile in someoneelse shoes,? he said. It was an echo of none other thanClinton remarks after the shooting of police officers in Dallas in July. ?I will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families,? Clinton said on CNN then. With all his stop-and-start black outreach, Trump appears to be honing the greatest of political skills: letting different audiences hear the same words and imbue them with different meaning. ?It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing. You're seeing it, I'm seeing it. And you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it,? as he said Fox News on Thursday. ?There's a ? there's somewhat ? and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of ? there's a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something. Something's going on that's bad. And what's going on between police and others is getting worse.? The racistcharge has deeply irkedTrump friends and allies. Bruce LeVell, the executive director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump who traveled with him in Ohio this week, expressed frustration with the negative labels affixed to Trump. ?It?s just unfair, unfortunately, whathe had to endure,? LeVell said. ?Idon believehe changed his tone and tenor. Donald Trump has been clear since day onehe for all Americans.? Trump has drawn historically low support levels in polling among African-American voters, including some swing-state surveys over the summer in Ohio and Pennsylvania that showed him with 0 percent. He has climbed from such lows, claiming his numbers are trending upward ?like a rocket ship? but he remains mired in single digits in most surveys. His approval among Latinos is not much better. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News, showed Trump with 17 percent support among likely Hispanic voters ? 10 points below what Mitt Romney received four years ago. Nearly 80 percent had negative feelings about Trump. Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster who has said Republicans must do better among minority groups to compete in national elections, said hecouldn be sure whoTrump spate of black outreach was truly targeting. ?Your question assumes a level of calculation that I am not sure is warranted,? Ayres said. Madeline Conway contributed to this report.",0.038895859,0.007528231,0.003764115,0.010037641,0.071518193,0.321204517,0.006273526,2,-1,1

"Sen. Ted Cruz had decided not to endorse Donald Trump during the Republican National Convention in July. | Getty Cruz: I'm voting for Trump 'Last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,' Cruz wrote. Ted Cruz on Friday said he would vote for Donald Trump for president and that he would encourage others to do the same, reversing months of opposition to his bitter primary rival. ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. Story Continued Below Cruz said he endorsed both because of his primary pledge to support the party nominee, as well as his concerns about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,"" Cruz said. ""Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable ?that why I have always been #NeverHillary."" A Trump adviser said Trump and Cruz spoke after the endorsement. For months, Cruz had avoided endorsing Trump, his primary foe in an intensely personal race. People close to him were sharply divided on Friday over the decision, hours before he made his endorsement. ?If he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,? said someone who had worked for Cruz's campaign. Steve Deace, a prominent conservative Iowa radio host who was a major Cruz backer, also tweeted Friday that the senator would endorse Trump. A spokeswoman for Cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ""This is gonna be a political disaster,"" Deace texted after Cruz made his decision official. ""Sad. Unavoidable. Entirely self inflicted."" Trump responded in a statement that he was ""greatly honored"" by the nod. ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent,"" Trump said. ""I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" Cruz had previously gone as far as to tell Republicans to ?vote your conscience? at the Republican National Convention, rather than urging them to get behind the nominee. Since then, Cruz, who may face a primary challenge in his 2018 Senate reelection campaign, has come under mounting pressure to get behind Trump, though many Cruz loyalists see an endorsement as unacceptable. At the outset of the Republican primary, Cruz went out of his way to praise Trump, expecting that the real estatemogul support would crumble, and Cruz would be the beneficiary. But as the primary continued and Trump moved into an increasingly strong position in the race, Cruz sought to fashion himself as the conservative alternative to Trump, repeatedly describing his opponent as a liberal who had few differences with Hillary Clinton. The race turned increasingly personal between the two, with Trump attackingCruz wife and seeking to linkCruz father to conspiracy theories about assassinating former President John F. Kennedy. On the day that he dropped out of the race, Cruz took his criticism of Trump to a new level, accusing him of being a ?pathological liar,? a ?serial philanderer? and an ?utterly amoral? ?bully.? The personal differences between the two of them, as well asTrump willingness to flaunt conservative orthodoxy that many Cruz loyalists embrace, has made supporting the nominee a nonstarter for many of thesenator most committed backers. But slowly, other conservative leaders, including many who backed Cruz in the primary, have gotten on board with Trump, and have made clear publicly that Cruz should do the same. They view the election as a binary election between Hillary Clinton and Trump, rather than accepting the more nuanced stance that Cruz took at the convention. ?I think he should give a nod of support,? said Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, who was previously an important Cruz backer. ?I think a lot of folks that supported Ted feel that way. Given the choices before us, yeah, I would like to see Ted give his support to Trump at this point.? The initial calculation at the RNC from many who backedCruz decision was that, assuming Trump went up in flames in November, Cruz would emerge from the election respected as one of the last principled conservatives, willing to serve as the final bulwark against a candidate who violated many of the values conservatives hold dear. Supporting Trump would tieCruz fortunes more closely to his, a possible complication for Cruz, whose fans have long wanted him to look at running for president again in 2020. But there is a more urgent need to attend to:Cruz unwillingness to support Trump has become an issue in his home state as he prepares for Senate re-election. The morning after he refused to support Trump at the RNC, the Texas delegation breakfast broke out into chaos as delegates split over whether or not Cruz should support the nominee. Since then, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), a possible Cruz primary challenger forCruz Senate seat, has been using thesenator unwillingness to support Trump as a means of attacking Cruz. McCaul attacked Cruz on the Laura Ingraham Show this week for breaking his pledge to support the nominee, declaring he was ?very angry? about the dissension. ?He broke his word,? said McCaul, the wealthy chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. The Texas senator has been gradually making moves to soothe his often poor relations with fellow senators since his primary loss, helping raise money for at-risk Republicans and donating $100,000 to the SenateGOP campaign arm. But many Republicans on Capitol Hill have prodded him to go further and hold his nose with an endorsement. While several Republicans saidCruz bloc of conservative voters could make the difference for Trump, others said any endorsement would be more about helping secureCruz own political standing thanTrump. ?Idon think endorsements matter,? said one Republican senator. Agreed Perkins, ?At this point, I thinkit probably more beneficial to Ted than it is to Trump, to show that Ted is a team player. And look,there a lot of folks, like myself, [for whom] Donald Trump was not our first choice. But he is working hard to gain the support and confidence of conservatives, and the alternative is clear.? Of people close to Cruz who disagree with any indication of support for Trump, some say that voting for Trump ? but attempting to distinguish between a vote and an endorsement, as senators such as Kelly Ayotte have done ? might be forgivable. But a full-on endorsement, especially one that would entail campaigning for the Republican nominee, would be harder to stomach.Cruz move toward his former rival takes away the most prominent anti-Trump holdout in Congress, leaving Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah as the remaining senators who either oppose orhaven supported Trump. Few have shown any inclination to followCruz lead. ?I?m against Hillary Clinton for president,that where I am,? Heller said Thursday. ?We?ll go through the debate and see how it plays out.? Lee,Cruz strongest defender and closest friend in the Senate, indicated he has no plans to followCruz lead. In a statement, Lee said he is watching ?each candidate's grasp of ? and willingness to work tirelessly to restore ? federalism and separation of powers. ?I am always eager to support any candidate willing to make those structural constitutional protections a priority. In this race and in every other, I will continue to use the same criteria,? Lee said. But Trump has made some overtures to Lee, on Friday including him on a list of his potential choices for a Supreme Court nomination. Lee was not interested. Asked about a possible endorsement of Trump, Jason Johnson,Cruz chief strategist on the campaign, responded with what appeared to be a photo of himself, with his hand over his face.

"Ted Cruz is in a bind when it comes to Donald Trump: Loyalists say he should stand by his epic non-endorsement in Cleveland. But Republicans pushing to finally unify the party as the election tightens sayit time for Cruz to get on board. Cruzhasn ruled out an endorsement and is still watching howTrump campaign performs down the homestretch, an aide said. But there is a renewed urgency after his former campaign manager told reporters this week that Cruz is warming toTrump more disciplined campaign. Cruz himself praised Trump for backing the Texassenator crusade to stop a handover of an Internet domain overseer to international regulators. Story Continued Below ?If Ted Cruz wants to call himself a Republican I think he should be at least a part of the team. It looks awfully self-serving for not endorsing Donald Trump at this time,? said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.). ?You?re on the same team, so youdon sit on the bench and sulk because youdidn get the starting job. If he wants to be called on in the future, he needs to show some character.? ?It would be helpful,? said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the SenateGOP campaign arm. ?If I were in TedCruz position, I would have gone ahead and made the case that of the choices available, Mr. Trump is far and away the best.? Cruz, of course, did exactly the opposite at the Republican convention, drawing boos and jeers from partisans after he urged delegates to ?vote your conscience.? It may have made him enemies among Trump supporters, but it also endeared him to those who have flocked to Cruz and his brand of ?principled conservatism.? Former aides said they would be crushed if Cruz suddenly came around to Trump after taking so much heat and refusing to back down. ?If Cruz's conscience didn't allow him to support Trump at the convention, I don't see any evidence that Trump has changed his behavior to allow Cruz's conscience to support Trump now,? said Amanda Carpenter, a former speechwriter and communications director for Cruz in the Senate. Rick Tyler, who ranCruz press shop during much of his presidential run, said that despite the pressure from Republicans, Cruz will be doneif he endorses Trump. ""There is no negative future stemming from his defense of conservatism speech in Cleveland,? Tyler said in an email. ?Either Trump loses and the speech is cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a terrible President and the speech is again cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a great president, serves 2 terms and everyone forgets it.? Privately, some Republicans interpreted former campaign manager JeffRoe comments on Wednesday at a Bloomberg event as laying the groundwork for an eventual endorsement of Trump. And hours later, Trump joinedCruz latest legislative effort aimed at keeping U.S. authority over Internet domain names. Cruz offered his appreciation on Twitter for Trump's support, andTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reciprocated with her own appreciation of Cruz. Cruz met privately with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence last week and emerged calling Pence a ?strong conservative.? But Cruzhasn done much else to indicate publicly he'll be voting for Trump over Hillary Clinton. And Cruz is not alone among Senate Republicans: The likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona,, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Dean Heller of Nevada have all either declined to offer an endorsement of anyone or said outright theywon vote for Trump. But none carries the kind of political weight Cruz does ? not to mention the millions of followers. ?Mr. Trump is our nominee and Sen. Cruz represents a big electoral state and is very popular in Texas,? said Texas Rep. Joe Barton. ?It certainly would be helpful, I think, for the Trump campaign to haveCruz endorsement. Cruz has begun to fundraise for his colleagues and transferred $100,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, important bridges toward his colleagues in the cliquey Senate. But some GOP senators said Cruz finds himself caught between a party he wants to lead and a faction of the GOP that would never forgive him, including prominent conservatives like radio host Steve Deace, who said on Wednesday that ""if someone with Cruz's moxie can't hold the line in the GOP it can't be done. So just burn it down""It potentially a no-win situation that Republicans are sympathetic to. ?If you look at the positionhe in,let say Donald Trump wins: Probably not good for Ted Cruz. Donald Trump loses: Probably not good for Ted Cruz,? said a Republican senator. ?It?s a big liability.? Moreover,Cruz potential foe in his 2018 reelection race, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), spent the week picking atCruz vulnerability on Trump. He said Cruz's position makes him ""very angry."" ?What he did at the convention turned off a lot of people. He pledged to support [Trump]. He broke his word,? McCaul said on the Laura Ingraham show. A month ago, the terrain looked different for Cruz. Trump was lagging behind Clinton and Republicans were preparing for a blowout, making Cruz less culpable for blame given the widespread belief that Trump himself was the problem. But now the election is close and polls show Trump surging in swing states. Republicans sayCruz support could help put Trump over the top and help solidify his position in states that he won in the primary like Colorado, Maine or Wisconsin. On the other hand, a narrow Trump loss could lead to finger-pointing if Cruz doesn't bring on board his supporters. ?I think he wants to part of the team. I thinkhe very bright, I thinkhe capable of really adding something to it. But he also is concerned with being principled in this particular case,? said Sen.

"The Battleground Project Trump puts a boiling battleground in play In pivotal North Carolina, two contentious local issues are overshadowing almost everything else. When Donald Trump took his campaign to High Point, North Carolina, Tuesday, his topics ranged broadly from trade to immigration to terrorism. In other words, none of the hot-button issues that are currently roiling the political landscape in the battleground statethat looking increasingly essential to his hopes of winning. Unlike the presidential contest in nearly every other swing state, NorthCarolina is framed this year by two local battles overshadowing almost everything else. Story Continued Below There is House Bill 2 ? the so-called bathroom bill which has energized young liberals and older conservatives inwhat viewed by many as a battle for the soul of the state. Then there is the furor over voting rights, which has provided Democrats with a major organizational and energy boost among African-Americans. ?The intensity that you see on the national level is on steroids in North Carolina, because not only do you have this presidential race wherethey both here all the time, you also have a highly-chargedgovernor race and Senate race with the issues of HB2 and voting rights litigation all rolled up into one,? explained Bruce Thompson, a Raleigh attorney and a longtime, high-profile Hillary Clinton supporter in the state. ?There cannot be another state that has that kind of intensity. It comes up in every conversation.It not just the insiders talking about it. It comes up on the sidelines of mydaughter field hockey games."" The two issues form a unique backdrop in a place that suddenly occupies a pivotal role on a hardening electoral map. Top Clinton aidescan envision a scenario in which Trump loses North Carolina but wins the White House. In a memo circulated to donors on Monday evening, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook framed thestate 15 electoral votes as something close to a must-win for Trump. The Trump campaign is acting accordingly, with three straight weeks featuring visits to the state from the GOP nominee, including his rally Tuesday. His allies are hoping the polarizing politics surrounding HB2 and roughly 35 legal showdowns in Raleigh this month about voting rights will rally conservatives to his side, putting a GOP-leaning state squarely in his column, and stamping out Democrats' Southern advances in one ofClinton most frequently visited states. Democrats believe the local fireworks provide Clinton with an unprecedented chance to juice up enthusiasm among young voters, college-age whites and African-Americans ? the groupsshe relying on to capture the state. The contentiousgovernor race has set the tone, with GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper locked in a contestthat been so defined byMcCrory signing of HB2 that Democrats have mulled how to saddle Trump with thegovernor baggage ? a twist on the mechanics of the presidential race in other swing states, where Democrats have framed Trump as drag on down-ballot candidates. ?It may be thatwhat keeping North Carolina in play is that Hillary could be gettingCooper coattails,? said one veteran Democratic operative in the state. The Trump campaign did not respond to several requests for comment. The ?bathroom bill? issue ? which is controversial largely because of its provision that individuals may only use government-funded restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth ? has become a defining one for Clinton, whose campaign has made a habit of seizing on local controversies in whichever stateshe visiting since the early days of her primary. North Carolina has seen businesses and some local entertainment staples flee since thebill passage in March, with few departures as politically stinging as the Atlantic CoastConference decision to pull its college football championship game from Charlotte or the NCAA's move to ax seven in-state events ? includingmen basketball tournament games. Wired Magazine this week estimated that the bill had cost North Carolina nearly $400 million already. ""They are huge things that are happening within the state and I think not only is it going to help us,? addedClinton states director, Marlon Marshall. ?It?s going to help Democrats up and down the ticket.? According to an Elon University poll released Tuesday, 60 percent of likely voters said NorthCarolina national reputation is worse as a result of the passage of HB2.Clinton in-state forces have used the headlines to highlight what they say is Republican-led intolerance that has led to economic harm ? a casethat animated the highly educated white voters in the Research Triangle area who could carry her to victory. Speaking last week in Greensboro, where some of the basketball games would usually be played, Clinton hammered the message home: ?Look atwhat happening with the NCAA and the ACC,? she said. ?This is where bigotry leads, and wecan afford it."" The Democratic nominee has also weighed in on the voting rights fightthat been raging since the state implemented rules eliminating same-day registration and requiring an ID in 2013, calling such regulations ?a blast from the Jim Crow past? in early September as she campaigned in Charlotte.Clinton in-state team has four lawyers working on staff to bolster her voter protection program, and Democratic attorneys there have been engaged in thisfall fight since 2014. But the dispute returned to the forefront earlier this month after a series of legal rulings about thestate voting laws ? including one from the Supreme Court that restored one-stop early voting ? pushed the onus onto thestate counties to construct plans for approval by the Republican-led State Board of Elections. Democrats then piled lawyers in to work with the local proposals, guaranteeing they had legal representation in each of the more than 30 counties where there was a fight over the plan. Ensuring that voters can take advantage of one-stop early voting could help Clinton enormously with thestate large population of rural African-Americans who are not registered voters. And it gave the Clinton campaign a chance to rally black voters in the cities around the idea that the restrictions were racially motivated in the first place. ?There will be more early voting in North Carolina than there was in 2012,? explained Marshall, making the case that the very presence of more early voting will be a motivator. ?That?s a way to energize our base, and get them to show up to the polls."" Trump, for his part, has also drilled down on North Carolina. The attention has paid off:He within 1 percentage point of Clinton according to the POLITICO Battleground States polling average. According to the new Elon poll, when including voters leaning toward one of the candidates, Trump and Clinton were deadlocked at 45 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson pulling 7 percent of the vote. Unlike Clinton, Trump's focus in North Carolina has been on an anti-trade deal message that especially resonates among older, white working class voters who have lost jobs in industries like textiles. ""Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through,"" he said at his High Point rally.",0.030525031,0.002442002,0.004884005,0.010989011,0.048840049,0.267399267,0.007326007,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump, left, listens to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi, right, during a meeting at the Lotte New York Palace hotel on Sept. 19. | AP Photo Trump praises autocratic Egyptian leader NEW YORK ? There's at least one Muslim country that Donald Trump has ""great respect"" for. The Republican presidential nominee Monday showered Egypt's increasingly autocratic ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with kind words during a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Story Continued Below Trump, who has called for a ban on immigration from countries ""compromised by terrorism,"" which presumably would include Egypt, promised to invite Sisi to visit the White House if he's elected president. Trump also suggested he'd like to visit Egypt. In a strikingly praise-filled summary of the meeting released by his campaign, the Republican was said to express to Sisi ""his strong support forEgypt war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Trump also was said to have ""emphasized"" to Sisi ""his high regard for peace-loving Muslims."" The statement came the same day that the real estate mogul, responding to a suspected terrorist attack in New York, lamented that police officers weren't allowed to use racial profiling. Sisi also met with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both the 2016 candidates have been criticized by people across the political spectrum for sparing any time for Sisi, whose harsh rule has infuriated human rights activists. But Egypt is still considered a vital ally for the United States, not least because it maintains a peace deal with Israel and is a relatively stable Arab country in an increasingly volatile Middle East. It also is considered an important partner in the battle against Islamist militancy. The meeting between Trump and Sisi also included Trump advisers, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the readout, Trump expressed ""great respect forEgypt history"" and a ""great fondness"" for the Egyptian people. The readout did not say what Sisi said in return to Trump. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday from POLITICO.",0.030821918,0,0.003424658,0.010273973,0.058219178,0.311643836,0.020547945,2,-1,1
" The story of how a group of black clubgoers were turned away at the door of a club is going viral. Ashley Ellis Sisco and a group of friends attempted to visit the Kandy Bar in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were turned away at the door and told they needed a membership to get in, but a group of white girls behind them told them thatwasn the case. The bouncers, clearly racially profiling, allowed the white girls to enter while Sisco filmed them turning away a black man with dreads. Sisco later posted in the comments that ?the sad thing is that we all work in public service. It was a group of nurses, teachers, bankers people who serve the community and work with every race and ethnicity without judgement?.and we have to go back into the community we serve and be treated like trash.? It is clear that in North Carolina, a state where support for the Confederacy still is very strong, racism is still a major part of their identity, and this kind of display of casual racism makes it clear how Donald Trump is so popular in this country.

"Donald Trump mocked Hillary Clinton's planes and needled her for ""taking the day off."" | Getty Trump needles Clinton: ?Sleep well Hillary ? see you at the debate!? Hillary Clinton is a copycatwho probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday. In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing ?two big rallies? in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of ?copying my airplane? and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof. Story Continued Below ?Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies ? she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,? Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning. ?Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,? he added minutes later. ?Sleep well Hillary ? see you at the debate!?Trump critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, ?The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.? Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her ?very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry thatwe seen coming from my opponent.? ?You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,? she added. ?I?ve been at this and, you know, I understandit a contact sport.?

I think you have to"" Washington (CNN) New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious.

"With seven weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton and her allies are set to outspend Donald Trump and his allies by wide margins during the homestretch. A whopping 95 percent of all campaign television ad spending scheduled between today and Election Day ? more than $143 million worth ? comes fromClinton team, according to an ABC News analysis of CMAG/Kantar Media data. Team Clinton will spend $143.2 million on television ads, versus only $6.8 million for Team Trump. The difference in future spending in key battleground states is even starker ? with Team Clinton slated to spend 53 times as much as Team Trump on television ads in Florida between now and Nov. 8. In Florida, Clinton is spending $36.6 million, versus just under $700,000 for Trump. The differences continue in Ohio ($20.9 million versus $1.8 million), Pennsylvania ($18.8 million versus $1.5 million) and North Carolina ($14.3 million versus $1.3 million.) Those are crucial states forTrump campaign. If he wins all four, he will almost certainly land in the White House. If he loses even one, it will be very difficult for Clinton to lose the general election. Recent polling in these states has shown a tight matchup but a lead for Clinton in Pennsylvania. While ads for the campaigns are guaranteed to be at lower prices during these final 60 days, outside groups can get charged steep prices.That whyit important that Priorities USA Action has already scheduled so many ads: It will be paying less thanTrump outside groups ? like the NRA and his super PACs ? will be paying if they try to schedule ads now.Clinton campaign is footing the bill for slightly more than half her scheduled television advertising, whileTrump campaign is slated for about $4 in $10.Clinton behemoth super PAC accounts for virtually all the rest of pro-Clinton spending, andTrump spending is splintered among the NRA and two other super PACs. Team Clinton has already spent $174 million on television ads during the general election, versus a mere $40 million for Trump and his allies. The contrast is also stark when comparing only the campaigns: $110.7 million for Clinton versus $18.7 million for Trump.

"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human: HillaryClinton top aide Huma Abedin recently separated from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a photo surfaced of Weiner sexting some random chick with their son right next to him. The Bunny Ranch legal brothel responded by offering Weiner a full time position as the director of social media, and we all laughed. But this? This is no laughing matter.It sick. According to that sourcelink, Weiner carried out a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. She claims he asked her to dress up in ?school-girl? outfits and allegedly ?pressed her to engage in ?rape fantasies.'? The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and beforeWeiner wife, HillaryClinton aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ended their marriage. Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. He knew this and sent her completely disgusting, inappropriate messages anyway. He sent her ?bare-chested? photos of himself, called her ?baby,? complimented her body and even told her he woke up hardthinking about her. In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen: ?I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.? The teen said she originally reached out to Weiner on Twitter in January. She said she was interested in politics and heard about his sexting scandals and wanted to know more about him. It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com shedidn consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a romanticone. She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed. ?Why did I message you [in January]?? the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week. ?I was studying you- for a book of course. You were my Hannibal Lecter. ?I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. Ididn want to appear suspicious.? She also told Weiner: ?I was obsessed with you.? Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and thegirl home state. From there, he sent her a friend request on Facebook, and the rest is history. The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. ?[Weiner?s] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,? she said. ?So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.? Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing ?I caught a glimpse of your body? and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype. She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat. She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers. ?He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,? said the girl. ?He would ask me to take my clothes off. ?He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,? she added. Weinerdidn deny messaging the teen and refused to address the specific allegations. ?I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,? Weiner said. ? I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.? Weiner just got 195 times more disgusting. I know. Ididn think it was possible either. If only his first name was Bill and his last name was Clinton. Then everyone would laugh about these sexual escapades. h/t Daily Mail",0.042769857,0.012219959,0.00610998,0.028513238,0.073319756,0.256619145,0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Poll: 62% say Clinton won, 27% said Trump did It's a similar result to Romney topping Obama in four years ago (CNN) Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romney's dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. The gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in Clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt Trump did better on that score.

"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation ? where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners ? the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed goodthat the foundation has done over the years. Idon think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence thatthey an organization for good. The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: Just 5.7 percent of the ClintonFoundation massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exemptorganization IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and ?other expenses.? The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, theorganization IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as ?other expenses,? while the remaining almost $851K was marked as ?professional fundraising expenses.? Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more ?other expenses? in 2014. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers. Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate: 1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface. When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents? trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, ?How are you, Donald?? Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting. Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, ?But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,? before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, ?Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.? He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as ?Secretary Clinton,? although itwasn completely clear during the moment. 2. Personal Attacks Came Early Clinton was first to go on the attack duringtonight debate, taking aim atTrump business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business. ?Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,? Clinton said, before expanding on herfather work as a drapery maker. Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in ?trumped up, trickle-down? economics. ?For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,? Trump said. 3. Trading Barbs Over Trade Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim. ?And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,? Trump said. Clinton fired back, ?Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.? Trump then pointed toClinton once referring to TPP as the ?gold standard of trade deals.? ?Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,? Clinton said. Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.? Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that ?what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.? 4. Trump Asks ?Why Not? Blame All theWorld Problems on Clinton Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.? Trumpdidn miss a beat, saying to his opponent: ?Why not?? Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this?? Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,? before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."" Drew Angerer/Getty Images 5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns. ?I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,? he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general. Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. ?I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,? he said. ?I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,? she said. ?You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns? ?Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,? she said. 6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump ?what took you so long? to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republicannominee recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years. At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into BarackObama birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was satisfiedwith when Obama released his birth certificate. Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions aboutit authenticity until 2015. ?Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,? Trump said, referencing the years between the release andTrump decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. ?I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.? Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images 7. Clinton Defends Being PreparedWhen Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, ?I?ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,? seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare fortonight faceoff. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,? Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.? Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance. 8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of DiscussionTrump support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate. ?Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,? Trump said. Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that ?it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.? ?They would have won an appeal,? he said, noting that there was no appeal. Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate. 9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started. ?I did not support the war in Iraq,? Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.? Holt corrected him, saying, ?The record shows otherwise.? The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, ?Are you for invading Iraq?"" Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, ?Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.? Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, ?The record shows that I am right.? 10. Sparring Over Stamina Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a ?presidential look,? asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her ?stamina.? ""She doesn't have the look, shedoesn have the stamina,? Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.? Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down. ""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,? Clinton said. She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women: ""One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,? Clinton said. ""But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.?",0.04437401,0.009508716,0.006339144,0.00792393,0.073692552,0.28526149,0.000792393,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Donald Trump has repeatedly said he does not regularly exercise For as little as $12, supporters can own a campaign-sanctioned sweatband (CNN) Even though Donald Trump has said he does not exercise, his supporters can still break a sweat in campaign style. The Republican presidential nominee's campaign is offering a ""Make America Great Again"" sweatband in exchange for a campaign donation. This comes just a week after Trump told Dr. Mehmet Oz he doesn't actually exercise , and ultimately wants to lose 15 pounds.

"While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him,it annoying ? but not in the way one might think. As black people ? who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed ? lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters: Trump and I believethere been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement. Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of ?Build that Wall.? Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or talkas Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug usedoesn make it go away. The statistics tell us all we need to know: So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been ?far too much? for his andTrump comfort. Newsflash, Pence:you running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race. We already know Trumpdoesn care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care.That been shattered. Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.

"In the wake of the recent rioting and looting in NC, officers at one Charlotte police station were in for a heck of a shock when a little black boy came stumbling into the station totally unannounced. Even before the child had a chance to speak a word, one officer quickly called over her fellow officers in the station and rushed towards the boy. The horrifying episode for this young boy all started when he was woken up by sirens and helicopters from outside during the riots on Tuesday. The riots were happening just outside the boy's window, but naturally he was completely unaware of why any of this was happening, or even what was really happening. The next day, on the way to school, the boy's mother, Deanna Hooker was playing the radio and the two heard a news report about how several officers were injured in the rioting and attacks. Deanna had no idea how much the riots and news of the injured officers had really affected her son. After seeing so much hate in the news in and his surrounding community Deanna was rather surprised to hear her son's idea. The boy thought about the riots for days and the impact that they had on him and continued to have on him. He wanted to make an impact himself for those who risk their lives to keep him safe. ""He asked me if he could bring the police donuts and give them hugs for all they do,"" Deanna's Facebook post read that was later shared by Love What Matters. With a little help from his mom he was able to carry out this very kind and meaningful gesture. He wore a sign around his neck that read, ""Free hugs,"" and carried in a big donut box. Deanna's son walked into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and gave the officers his two gifts. He didn't just tell one officer about how he felt, he made sure to go around to every single officer to tell them how he felt about the service they do for him and his mother. ""It is amazing how much children can teach us during times like this,"" Deanna's post said about her amazing son. This mom should be proud of her son for having such a steady view in such a chaotic world. She deserves some credit as well for having instilled such great values in her amazing son.

"They were searching for years. It finally happened. They eventually found their onetrue gem after lastyear failure. Now after years of searching, liberals finally feel likethey seen a woman who can win the Presidency. Ironically, the notion to find a TV star candidate was stolen from the fact that President Trump had a bit of a TV career to go along with the rest of his business ventures.It also not lost on anyone that there are no two names more synonymous with wealth in America than Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey.It quite funny that people on the left kept spouting off that youcan have a television billionaire run for President ? but now they have their television billionaire they want to run for President. Funny how that works, right? The left has literally copied exactly what the right does becausethey unable to craft their own winning strategy. Liberals have found PresidentTrump antithesis and plan to run her against him in the next presidential election of 2020. Winfrey is also boosted by the fact that she has a couple of social justice warrior bonus points working in her favor;she black, andshe a she. She has everything that they said Hillary had, but without that annoying and predatory Bill tagging along for the free ride. The one other thing that Oprah has in common with President Trump is that her careerhasn been in politics. Shehasn had to look over her shoulder and watch her mouth for her entire life.She just been giving out prizes from under the seats of her show set and participating in other business ventures that have nothing to do with politics. In the case of President Trump, thatdidn matter too much, because hewasn running on a platform of political correctness.That where they differ. Oprah would most likely be on the plan with political correctness, something that America has gotten sick of hearing about. Oprah has given numerous honest and very liberal opinions over the years, and that is now coming back to haunt her. To make matters worse, the bumbling mainstream media is jumping up to defend her, andit not going well.It scary to think of Oprah Winfrey in the Oval Office as anything more than a guest taking a tour. Her unashamed opinion on race issues and disdain for white people could be a problem. The longtime TV host has become increasingly anti-white over the years, to the point thatshe handing down a proverbial death sentence to those whodon agree with her. Her idea is that racism is a problem of the past, so to fix the problem, those who lived in that time just need to die.That right folks. It was a horrible thing she said, and this video would be the bane of her existence if she ever ran for President. Oprah said as much in an interview in 2013: Oprah's solution to racism; Old white people ""just have to die"". What a horribly divisive message. pic.twitter.com/NOtaft2xxf ?

For a billionaire there could have been a more ""eloquent "" way to say this. Money doesn't buy class. ? Kim (@KimKing2018) January 8, 2018It difficult to see someone who is considered to be a national leader asking for the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans.It even more painful to think people would want her to run the country with that attitude. Now, to be fair,she probably right about a small fraction of the older generation. There will always be at least a few people who say racially inappropriate things, but they do not stand for or represent the majority of our good Americans. Even if there are a few old cronies with a racist bone in their body, thatdoesn mean everyone is like that. That alsodoesn mean Oprah should call for a mass genocide of old white people. That is a terrible and racist thing to say. It makes Oprah look like the black female Hitler who calls for the killing of a particular kind of people. Is that who the American people would want to vote for? Idon think so. It is NOT EVER OK to suggest that Americans try to kill people off just because they disagree with someone. What Oprah said is unforgivable and disgusting. We cannot believe she would say anything like that. This probably seems exceptionally radical, based on what she just said, that someone would try to kill an old person becausethey racist, butit perhaps not as far-fetched as you might think. Currently, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have ?death with dignity? laws that allow a terminally ill patient to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death. This practice is also called euthanasia, which is a term that encompasses any physician-assisted suicide, and it dates back as far as ancient Greece and Rome. The United States is beginning to accept the reasoning that a person might need to die before their natural time, based strictly on the quality of life. Right now, as with most of the new technologies offered to us,it optional. If we decide that our lifeisn worth living, we can end it. However, throughout most of history, ithasn been the patient choosing whether to pull their plug. In a socialist society, whereit all for one and one for all, someone always has to decide what will be for the ?greater good.? In fact, Euthanasia comes from the Greek words, Eu (good) and Thanatosis (death) and it means ?Good Death, ?Gentle and Easy Death.? This word is used for ?mercy killing.? Withdrawal or with-holding treatment was practiced in history, the correct term for this is orthothanasia, which means ?passive death.? If you combine that with the incredibly scary, and over-reaching liberties taken in the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare), then you can see how we were (and maybe still are) a hop, skip and a jump from the government choosing who lives and dies. If racism is considered cancer that should be cut out, then racism is redefined to mean anything liberals want, they would be able to hand down a death sentence to anyone the government wanted, by withdrawing care. ?Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.? That is what we were promised in the constitution, butwe now come full circle to the point where we need to depend on another truth given to us by a founding father: We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. ?

" DonaldTrump charity non-profit Trump Foundation does not exist for its stated purpose of helping those in need, unless one believes Trump himself is among the needy. Yes, Trump was so desperately in need he used the TrumpFoundation funds to purchase himself a lunch with a Hollywood actress. In 2008, Trump was a guest at a Gucci charity auction where he had an opportunity to bid on something he found too irresistible to pass up: a trip to France which included lunch with Salma Hayek which would take place in the husband of Hayek billionaireFran-HenriPinault vineyard. Comedian Chris Rock was hosting the auction and said the auction included ?Salma Hayek and her breasts?, which was like blood in the water for Trump. He feverishly bid on the potential meeting all the way up to the tune of $120,000 of the TrumpFoundation money. Surely a ritzy meal in abillionaire vineyard was the best way for Trump to help the needy. Trump bidding on the auction trip with thefoundation money very likely violated a non-profit law which prohibits ?self-dealing? as 501c3 organizations are required to disclose any use of money to purchase gifts for anorganization executives.Trump campaign says he did not personally take the trip, but could also not offer an elaboration as to who did actually take the trip to France. Even if Trump had given the trip to a family member, he would still be in violation. For her part Hayek, while a guest on ?Jimmy Kimmel Live? on March 30, 2016, said she and Trump have known each other for many years but did not state when they first met. She went on to callTrump politics madnessand wondered why so many individuals are supporting him. In later media appearances, Hayak was not nearly as charitable about Donald Trump. While a guest on ?The Late Late Show With James Corden? on August 4, 2016 Hayak said of Trump, ?We have a first-grade boy running for President of the United States.? Hayek has not been quiet about Trump ?s hateful rhetoric but she gave him points for showing the world racism still exists. While being interviewed on ?America with Jorge Ramos? on August 6, 2016 Hayak said, ?The good thing about what Trump did is thatit shown a light to the level of the problem of racism.? It is safe to say that during their years of knowing one another Hayek has had enough ofTrump sub-human personality, and if the two were to meet and converse in the future it would be a terse conversation.

"The State Department initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. | Getty Judge sets modest pace for release of FBI-found Clinton emails State Department ordered to process 1,050 pages of recovered messages by early November. The State Department has found about 5,600 work-related emails relevant to Hillary Clinton in a set turned over by the FBI at the end of its investigation into her private server setup, but it appears only about 10 percent of those will be processed for release to the public in advance of the November election. The pace of release ordered by a federal judge Friday is far slower than the State Department managed last year when it was disclosing as much as 7,000 pages per month from the roughly 54,000 pages of email records Clinton provided to her former agency at the end of 2014. Story Continued Below After a hearing in U.S. District Court, Judge James Boasberg issued an order requiring State to process 1,050 pages of the FBI-discovered email records by the election. They are to emerge publicly in three batches, on Oct. 7 and 21 and Nov. 4. After that, State will continue to produce the emails . At the hearing, Boasberg initially said he would order the processing of 1,050 documents in the case by early November, but he later revised his direction to require only that many pages. State initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch urged the judge to put all 5,600 emails out before the election. ""What we are looking for is as much quick turnaround as possible,"" Judicial Watch attorney Lauren Burke said. However, the judge suggested it was ""unrealistic"" to expect all 5,600 messages to be processed in the next six weeks. The judge acknowledged a public interest in getting the records out before voters go to the polls Nov. 8, but he repeatedly expressed sympathy for the challenges State has faced in responding to dozens of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to the emails of Clinton and her top aides. He also said he was reluctant to disrupt processing of records in those other cases. ?I think we all need to bear in mind the State Department has other duties beyond FOIA requests,? said Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. ?I know the State Department has been working very hard. ... The courtcan jump to the head of the queue.? After the hearing, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said he disagreed with thejudge ruling. However, Fitton saved his real firepower for the State Department, saying the agency is overseeing ?an absolutely corrupt process.? ?The State Department is being obstructionist. They have had these records since July andthey only released five records,? Fitton said, referring to a smattering of messages released in other cases seeking information on specific topics. ?It?s an obvious slow-walking.? A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred to a statement in which spokesman John Kirby said State ?voluntarily agreed? to turn the messages over to Judicial Watch even though they were not inState possession at the time of thegroup request. He said the records will be posted onState website whenthey been processed. Justice Department lawyers atFriday hearing provided more insight into what the FBI turned over to State. Attorney Lisa Olson said the main disk of recovered Clinton emails contained 15,171 documents, of which more than 60 percent, or over 9,400, were ?deemed purely personal? during a recent ?appraisal.? That left about 5,600 considered work-related at least in part, she said, althoughKirby statement said some of those may also be deemed entirely personal after further review. Just how much new information will emerge by the election or thereafter remains unclear, for a variety of reasons. Many of the 5,600 emails are likely to be duplicates or what State calls ?near-duplicates? of the ones Clinton already turned over. (State says a ?near-duplicate? is an already-processed message with a nonsubstantive notation, like a request to print it out.) Olson said atFriday hearing that the duplicates appear to be a significantand substantialnumber of the overall set. Another Justice lawyer, Marcia Berman, said she believed a sampling of the 5,600 found ?almost half? were duplicates or nearly so. In addition, State could decide to withhold some of the messages in their entirety, in which case they would still count as processed pages even though the publicwouldn see them. Classified emails are being treated separately. Olson said a set of those records FBI turned over to State appears to be almost entirely duplicative of material State already processed. State could exceed thejudge order but seems unlikely to proceed much faster given the litany of statements the agency has made about being under-staffed and overburdened by FOIA requests and lawsuits relating to emails exchanged by Clinton and her close aides. There also the possibility another judge handling a related case could order faster production, but the chance of that also seems remote. DuringFriday hearing, Berman said the State Department no longer has the level of staffing in the FOIA section that it did when the agency was cranking out thousands of pages a month from the main set of Clinton emails. ?Many of those folks have returned to their regular duties,? Berman said. ?There?s been a lot of attrition.It a very difficult and demanding job these days ... and not a lot of fun.?",0.077531646,0.003164557,0.001582278,0.02056962,0.113924051,0.27056962,0,2,-1,1

" Once again, Donald Trump and the RepublicanParty fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points ? vilifying Syrian refugees. ?These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country? yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th. He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: ?Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart.It sickness, andit hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.? In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen ? and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw theman face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do. He called the cops. ?I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the samething?m from Sikh faith.I been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution? said Bains toCNN Chris Cuomo.He absolutely right ? because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees becausethey Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States. The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains? actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would. For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence ofMateen radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and hiscampaign racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America ? not refugee or immigrants.

Most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage.Clinton supporters have called for aggressive fact-checking duringMonday debate, saying that members of the media have failed to adequately fact-check and correct falsehoods from her Republican rival.NBC Matt Lauer was recently criticized for not correcting several false statements from Trump during a presidential forum on the network. Spokespeople for the networks told POLITICO that on-screen fact checks would be hard to execute in real-time, which is why they were opting out. That leaves the real-time fact-checking up toNBC Lester Holt, the debate moderator, or the candidates themselves. Several other news organizations, including NPR, have said they will conduct fact-checks of the debate online and in their post-debate analyses. Hadas Gold contributed reporting to this post.

"Story highlights The State Department is expected to release fewer than 1,000 pages of Hillary Clinton's emails recovered from her private server before Election Day, per a federal judge's order Friday Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday ordered the State Department to release some, but not all, of the emails recovered from Hillary Clinton's private server by the FBI ahead of the presidential election in November. DC District Court Judge James Boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and November 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. It is unclear exactly how many pages the State Department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. That's because a ""substantial number"" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a Justice Department attorney representing the State Department said in court. The State Department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the FBI, believed to have been sent by or to former Secretary Clinton while she was in office. Of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related. Production will begin October 7, with subsequent releases October 21 and November 4 -- four days before the election. Read More",0.0625,0,0,0.00625,0.0875,0.18125,0,2,-1,1

"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton. Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island. Story Continued BelowThat according to The POLITICO Caucus ? a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues. ?She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,? said a Nevada Democrat ? who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ?Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.? ?The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,? a New Hampshire Democrat added. ?Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.? One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee. ?Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,? said the Ohio Democrat. ?She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.? Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states. ?Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,? said an Ohio Republican. ?Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance ? and maybe her last chance.? ?She has to stop [Trump?s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,? added a Virginia Republican. ?All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.? Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure ? 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans ? most pointed to the GOPnominee volatile personality. ?Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,? said a Michigan Republican. ?The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.? ?The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?? added a Michigan Democrat. ?Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?? Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey: Most insiders expect Clinton to winthe debate. Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans. ?Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,? said an Iowa Republican. ?[Clinton?s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,? added a New Hampshire Democrat. But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton ? or the media through which voters will interpret the debate. ?The press wants Trump to win,? said a Florida Democrat. ?Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.? Some Republicans also claimed media bias ? in the other direction. ?The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,? a Virginia Republican said. ?But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.? Insiders think the debate will matter. Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates. Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percentdon expect the debate to move the needle. ?Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),? a Michigan Democrat predicted. ?The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.? The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said itwouldn have a significant impact. ?Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,? said a New Hampshire Republican. ?He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.? But some Republicans said Clinton could stuntTrump momentum with a strong performance Monday night. ?If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],? said an Iowa Republican. ?If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.? Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race. ?We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,? an Iowa Republican said. ?Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.? Added a Florida Democrat: ?Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.?

"Washington  Kix Brooks, one half of the country music duo Brooks and Dunn, is not buying the gloom and doom expressed on the campaign trail about America's declining greatness -- often espoused by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" ""We've always been great, as far as I'm concerned,"" the country music artist, whose classic 2001 hit ""Only America"" with Ronnie Dunn became an anthem for patriotism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, told CNN. ""There's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. That's our project as Americans -- we always work to be better,"" he continued. But Brooks, who considers himself to be ""fairly conservative,"" is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if Washington remains gridlocked and the US continues to be as ""polarized"" as it is today. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to work with Congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute ""common sense"" gun-control measures. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico. ""I think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer,"" Brooks told CNN. ""None of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says."" On gun culture Lamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" artist said that the right to bear arms is an American principle that ""should be respected."" ""We do have a Second Amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way,"" Brooks said. ""My only concerns are that Second Amendment rights are discussed with so much ferocity that sometimes we don't hear what each other is saying.""

MUST WATCH Brooks and Dunn's Kix Brooks on southern cooking 02:50 Brooks, who is an avid hunter, grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, along the Red River, and as he toured the country to play music over the last two decades, he witnessed a stark cultural divide between rural and urban America when it comes to guns. While Americans in rural America ""never considered what a gang was,"" Brooks said, those in urban America also don't understand that ""having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life"" for Americans like him. Brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in American cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural America. ""I don't feel like what's good for California is good for Tennessee, is good for Louisiana, is good for New York City,"" Brooks said,"" adding, that local ""leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than Washington, D.C., does."" And as for election 2016, Brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends ""to listen more closely."" On 'Only in America' Many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. However, when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama played Brooks and Dunn's ""Only in America"" at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, that was not the case. ""Seems ironic that the same song Bush used at the Republican Convention last election would be used by Obama and the Democrats now,"" Brooks said at the time. ""Very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans."" Brooks, who was a supporter of President George W. Bush, said that he co-wrote ""Only in America"" with his friend and music producer Don Cook -- a Democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near Brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be Americans. ""The song was never meant to be political in any way. It still isn't,"" Brooks said. ""The song is patriotic ... Call it corny or flag-waving or whatever you want to, but I'm really sincere about it.

In his final address as president before the United Nations general assembly, Obama was critical of the isolationist movement that Trump has championed in the U.S. and others have pushed abroad. Story Continued Below ?As these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest,? Obama said after discussing economic inequality and other international issues. ?Religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism, sometimes from the far left but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. ? ?Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,? the president continued. ?So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.? The president led his speech with a celebration of global accomplishments to which the U.S. has been party during his administration, listing the reduction of terrorists? safe havens, the landmark nuclear agreement with Iran and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba as successes. But Obama also listed global problems like the flow of refugees, continued financial disruptions, and a lack of basic order and security in the Middle East. The president urged the international community ?that we must go forwards and not backwards,? offering a defense of Western values as the best path forward for global growth and success. ?I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century,? Obama said. ?I make this argument not based on theory or ideology but on facts.? In making that case, Obama warned against strongman governments and oppressive tactics like media suppression. He said such strategies are stifling for economies hungry for information and ultimately lead to further crackdowns or the scapegoating of foreign enemies that can lead to war. Speaking specifically of the Middle East, Obama called for the recognition of a ?common humanity? that would serve as a stepping stone toward resolving the various conflicts in the region. Again attacking isolationism, Obama said the rest of the world cannot turn its back on conflict in the Middle East in the hope that violence will be contained to the region. ?Until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer, most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas,? he said. ?And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.?",0.028350515,0,0.005154639,0.015463918,0.051546392,0.368556701,0.010309278,2,-1,1

Hillary is nearly certain to win 16 ? blue' states, including Washington D.C., which will garner her 191 electoral votes,? writes Mook in the nearly 2,000-word memo that was blasted out [to donors, supporters and volunteers] in the early evening, and which was obtained by POLITICO. ?If we add the five states that FiveThirtyEight.com gives Hillary a 70% or greater chance of winning (Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin), Hillary only needs 10 more electoral votes.? ... ??Put a different way, of these battleground states, Hillary can win just one (Florida, Ohio, or North Carolina) and win the presidency, which means the six additional states would only add more electoral votes to her total,? he writes. ?Donald Trump, on the other hand, must win six of these seven states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio ? none of which he can lose.?? http://politi.co/2cjjFVC ADELSON PONIES UP -- ?Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP,? byCNN Teddy Schleifer: ?The billionaire on Tuesday will disclose having given $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to George W.

FOR HRC -- FROM DARREN SAMUELSOHN: ?[Former President George H.W.] Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. ?That?s what he said,? she told POLITICO. ?Asked aboutTownsend [Facebook] post, George H.W.

"Story highlights The rancor comes after Priebus said party members need to ""get on board"" House Republicans said opposing Trump could impact political futures Washington (CNN) A brewing civil war within the GOP has House Republicans picking sides, with plenty of members backing up party Chairman Reince Priebus in threatening consequences for those who don't get behind nominee Donald Trump. ""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Arizona Rep. Trent Franks told CNN Wednesday. ""Therefore they are betraying this party. They are betraying the Constitution."" Franks had endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary. The rancor comes after Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that if Trump opponents don't ""get on board,"" it's not ""going to be that easy for them"" to run for office again. The remark appeared to be directed at former presidential candidates like Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who all have refused to endorse Trump after signing a pledge to do so during the primary campaign. Read More",0.032258065,0,0.019354839,0.012903226,0.058064516,0.264516129,0,2,-1,1

"Karen Dunn is polite, precise and barely more than five feet tall -- but after BarackObama dreadful first debate against Mitt Romney in 2012, she got up in the face of the leader of the free world. ?You need to punch him in the mouth!? said Dunn. Story Continued Below And Obama did ? delivering a powerful, campaign-stabilizing performance at Hofstra University on Long Island, the location ofMonday critical showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, a debate that is likely to be the most watched political event in history.It not clear if Dunn and her partner Ron Klain ? the two most experienced debate prep specialists in Democratic politics ? are giving Hillary Clinton the same advice. But they are overseeing an orderly and intensely secretive process designed to armor a battle-scarred debater for an unpredictable face-off that presents great dangers ? but also an opportunity for Clinton to reverse the fall narrative of a Trump surge.Clinton team of lawyers are facing the greatest challenge of their professional lives ? andthat saying a lot, considering that Klain, JoeBiden former chief of staff, was tapped by Obama to solve the Ebola crisis. They know that Trump ? a quick-study political novice participating in the first one-on-one debate of his life ? is a wild card who can turn weeks of pouring over briefing books into mockery with a single, brilliant and bullying punch. ?The fear is thatshe get lost in the moment, and no one is better at seizing the moment than Trump,? said a longtime adviser to both Clintons. Indeed,thatwhat worryingClinton inner circle ? that victory will come down to something like tone, which she has always struggled with, vacillating between cold and severe to thoughtful and wry. But the traditional, substantive sessions now underway are key to settling thecandidate head, longtime aides said. ""The prep matters because it gives her the confidence to know she is armed,? said one longtime Clinton ally. ?She will feel more comfortable if she's prepared the way she likes to prepare.? Clinton, for all her knowledge, polling and top-tier coaching, has always been defined not by whatshe said on the debate stage but by howshe dealt with what her opponents have said about her. These debate moments have represented many of the biggest pivot points inClinton career ? from her deft parrying of Rick Lazio in 2000 to her collapse underObama fire at the disastrous Nov. 2007 debate in Philadelphia that demolished her frontrunner status. With Clinton, a conventional politician trapped in the reality TV world of 2016,it all about the reaction shot ? and the Dunn-Klain team is laboring mightily to make sure she gets it right. No secret on the Clinton campaign has been more closely guarded than the identity of the person who is impersonating Trump in the closed-door sessions staged atClinton Manhattan office and at her home in Chappaqua.Clinton advisers, in conversations over the last month, have repeatedly emphasized that the mock debate session, while important, is less vital than the informal law school sessions where Clinton hashes out her reactions and attacks. ?It?s a moot court set-up,? said a Clinton insider. ?She?s doing less of the usual mock debate sessions, with 100 people standing around, this time.? Another added that her preparation this year ?is more style than substance.They trying to prepare her for the different Trumps that might show up.? On Saturday, the New York Times reported that longtime Clinton aide Phillippe Reines had been playing the role of Trump in mock sessions. Several Democrats who have spoken to the participants told POLITICO that another person playing the role of interlocutor has been campaign chairman John Podesta, a sharp-tongued veteran operator known less for bluster than behind-the-curtain scheme-spinning. The buttoned-down, courtly Klain has also stood in parrying questions with Clinton, according to people close to the situation ? but both men have been less concerned with imitating Trump than preparing Clinton for the substance of the attacks, two keen attorneys framingClinton reactions in the precise, disciplined language their lawyerly candidate thrives on. ?It?s an unconventional year, andhe an unconventional candidate, so maybe preparationdoesn matter,? said David Axelrod, a former top strategist to President Obama. ?But in my experience, the candidate who comes on the stage, and can anticipate the rhythm of the thing, and knows what they want to do, has a huge advantage.? Insiders said Clinton's debate group has tried to frame every minute on the stage as a referendum on the issue of trust -- to convince voters with doubts about Clinton to contrast those concerns with how they feel about Trump handling the nuclear codes. But there is still fear of the unknown that is the other half of the equation on stage with her. ?You?re just not sure who is going to show up, so you have to do it, you have to assume he may be aggressive, or he may lay back,? communications director Jennifer Palmieri said. ?That?s hard to game out.?Clinton experience and confidence can make her an intimidating person to prep -- when you count her own three dozen on-stage debates there is arguably no one in American politics with more prime-time experience. Her coaches, however, are also longtime debate aficionados -- campaign consultants Joel Benenson, Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald all sit in on prep, as does Palmieri, longtime attorney Bob Barnett, senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan, Podesta, occasionally Bill Clinton, younger policy aides who have helped compile the thick green binders of prep materials, and others. Klain and Dunn, who report directly to Sullivan, not only offer an overarching strategy, but act as speechwriters -- line-writers, really -- paring down language and crafting practiced lines. ?I have a tendency to want to give a deep dissertation on an issue or a problem,? said Sen. Cory Booker, who Dunn has prepped for Senate debates. ?Karen knew she had to break me of the habit, but do it in a way that still allowed me to feel like Iwasn dumbing things down. She really studied me. She already knew the language I was using out there.? Like Clinton, Booker said he was hesitant to disgorge pre-packaged lines. But the forceful Dunn pressed him, just as she goaded Obama. ?Shedidn call them ?lines,?? he said. ?She called them ?moments.?? Dunn has even force fed some catchphrases to the notoriously message-resistant Clinton. In the primary debate in New Hampshire last February, which coincided with opening weekend of the new Star Wars movie, Dunn pennedClinton sign-off: ?thank you, good night, and may the force be with you.? Clinton loves the self-education aspect of the process. But she has long despised the confrontational aspects of the mock debate dry runs, even whenshe not on the stand -- she never participated in herhusband debate preps, a noticeable absence when she served as a top campaign adviser in every other aspect of his presidential campaigns. During a tense prep session after Bernie Sanders? stunning and slim win in the Mar. 8 Michigan primary, for instance, Clinton was so fed up with the criticisms being lobbed at her she decided to just do the job herself. When D.C. attorney Bob Barnett, who was playing Sanders, began peppering her with attacks in a drab hotel conference room, a clearly agitated Clinton shut the session down and declared, ?How about I play Bernie?? Over the next hour or so, Clinton ? to the surprise of her staff ? staged a credible and unvarnished version of Sanders? attacks on her economic plans and close ties to Wall Street, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. For a time, Sullivan took the role of the former secretary of state and framed several new responses that later became a staple ofClinton debate routine. ?It turned out to be one of the most productive sessions we had,? said a Clinton ally. Dunn and Klain have been through the fire before ? Klain was responsible for the strategy that helped John Kerry win his first debate against George W. Bush by attacking him for not catching Osama Bin Laden. And many ofObama top advisers, including his wife, Michelle, credit the Klain-Dunn team for his fall 2012 turnaround. Klain, known for his minutely drafted action memos, started ginning up an attack plan for the president before the first debate in Denver was even over. But it was the incongruous image of Dunn surrounded byObama male-dominated staff that woke up the president with her ?punch him in the mouth!? summons, a quote that, for many people, stuck. Unlike the rest ofClinton debate coaches, Dunn and Klain have day jobs. Dunn, who represents Uber, Apple and Oracle in her day job as a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner LPP, is a top litigator (and also HumaAbedin personal attorney). Klain works at Revolution, LLC, a private investment firm. But there hasn't been a Democratic presidential debate without one of them involved in decades. But coaches don't play. For Clinton, success against Trump on Monday night may have more to do with how she silently projects authority when under attack. ?If Trump can be positioned to bully her, that will probably be his biggest failing,? said another longtime Clinton insider. ?And her pushing him back politely, sothere a difference between his level and her level, that will be her biggest strength.? In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters. Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot ? a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else -- as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face ofTrump expected insults. If you want an insight into the attitudeClinton aides want her to portray, check out the latest episode of ?Between Two Ferns.?Clinton appearance on the web comedy sketch show, which posted Thursday, shows the Democrat at her silent best -- it was quickly hailed by critics as one of her most successful interviews, and the candidate who struggles with articulating a coherent positive message didn't even say much. She sat with a bemused expression on her face while comedian Zach Galifianakis lobbed the absurd at her, asking with a deadpan whether she would have to take a leave of absence from the White House if she got pregnant, and if she was ""down with TPP."" One of Clinton's finest moments in the primary debates was her non-reaction to Lincoln Chafee questioning her ?ethical standards? because of her email use. When asked by moderator Anderson Cooper if she wanted to respond, Clinton smiled and shook her head. ?No,? was her terse response, and the audience roared.",0.022275259,0.00477327,0.00477327,0.010342084,0.038186158,0.229116945,0,2,-1,1

"Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended ?stop and frisk,? but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico: In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address ?violence in the black community? and ?black-on-black crime.? Trump responded by proposing that ?stop-and-frisk? policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. ?I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,? Trump told the questioner. Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management. When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because theyhadn done anything wrong. Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as destructivein an interview with Buzzfeed. She added: ?In short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.?

Together, they have committed to investing, donating, and raising more than $650 million. The hefty pledge is just part of the WhiteHouse goal of $3 billion in humanitarian aid, and the announcement was made just as President Obama hosted a refugee summit with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, countries that have taken in thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn states.

The horribleshooting death of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Friday is ?just unbearable and needs to be intolerable,? Hillary Clinton said Tuesday. Speaking to radio host Steve Harvey, Clinton anxiously contrasted herself and her opponent, Donald Trump. ?Oh my gosh, can I have the whole hour?? Clinton said when asked what separates her from the Republican presidential nominee. ?I think it really comes down to our visions and our values. You know, I have a vision where we continue to pursue equality and justice and opportunity for everybody.?

How many times do we have to see this in our country?? Clinton asked, referring to the incident in which Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was shot dead by police despite having his hands up as he walked to his SUV with armed officers behind him. ?In Tulsa? An unarmed man? With his hands in the air? I mean, this is just unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.? For her part, Clinton suggested that she could be part of the solution to reform policing practices and remove bias by appealing to white Americans. ?You know, maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people, say, ?Look, this is not who we are.?We got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,? Clinton said. ?There are good, honorable, cool-headed police officers.We seen them in action in New York over the last, you know, 48 hours because of the terrorist attack. We can do better. We have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable, andwe got to have law enforcement respect communities and communities respect law enforcement because they have to work together.?

"Eighteen months ago, three junior senators attempted something their chamber had never considered, much lessaccomplished to roll back the long-entrenched federal ban on marijuana. Though all first-termers, thesenators Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul ofKentucky enough about the difficulties of marijuana politics to avoid any mention of full-scale legalization. They tailored the bill to focus narrowly on medical marijuana and the half-dozen stumbling blocks in federal law that have made it so difficult for Americans to get safe access to the increasingly popular drug. Story Continued Below They branded their bill with a clever acronym: the CARERS Act, for the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act of 2015, which, if passed, would do a number of sensible things: reclassify marijuana so that it is considered to have some medical value; permit banks to handle money from legal marijuana businesses; prevent the government from interfering with state-legal medical marijuana programs; exclude non-psychoactive marijuana extracts from the definition of marijuana; grant military veterans access to medical marijuana; and break thegovernment monopoly on medical marijuana research. To noone surprise, the bill went absolutely nowhere. But itdidn die. Despite being ignored by leadership, it managed to collect 16 cosponsors by the end of 2015, a laundry list of mostly Democrats, two Republicans and an independent. Then, early this year, a 17th name was added, and a surprising one at that: Lindsey Graham. The senior senator from South Carolina, an establishment Republican if ever there was one, a foreign policy hawk who ran for president this cycle in large part because he perceived RandPaul isolationism as a threat to national security, LindseyGraham represents a state thatdoesn even allow medicalmarijuana become one of the unlikeliest and potentially most influential of thebill backers because he is unique among the bill's cosponsors (now at 20), ashe the only one with a gavel. And unlike his colleagues among Republican leadership, Graham is using his authority to move the marijuana bill forward. In mid-July, he chaired a Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the pros and cons of changing the way the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies marijuana like it was heroin. Over the 4? decades of the war on drugs, there have been plenty of hearings on the dangers of marijuana, but before July 13 there had never been a hearing on marijuana's medical benefits. ?If there was one, I don't know about it,? Graham told POLITICO Magazine. The emergence of Graham as an honest broker of information on this issue reflects rapidly shifting attitudes among conservative Americans. Opposition to marijuana legalization among Republicans has withered from 60 percent in December 2014 to 42 percent in July 2016, while the percentage of Republicans in favor of legalizing pot has grown from 28 percent to 45 percent over the same period. But Graham does more than just add a prominent voice. His decision to chair a hearing was a critical step (though no guarantee) toward getting a vote on the CARERS Act in the full Judiciary Committee, the only avenue by which it can reach the Senate floor. Graham, he is at pains to point out, rejects marijuana for recreational use, but he told POLITICO Magazine, ?I am open-minded to the idea that the plant may have medical attributes that could help people.?I'm convinced that we should, as a nation, research the medical applications of the marijuana plant....It could be life-changing. I just want to do it in a scientificway the current system doesn't allow for the research that we need.? ***We seen this before, when public opinion swings suddenly on a divisive cultural issue and yanks lawmakers along by the arm. It happened with gay marriage, and the impetus of the change is always personal experience.Graham conversion has been no different. ?I have several people that I personally know who have children who have some epilepsy and other diseases,? Graham told POLITICO, ?and the parents seem to think this helps.And stuns me is how little we know and how much more we could know. Some of these [diseases], like epilepsy, the families tell us that it has changed the child's life.That why I want more research. Is that anecdotal, or is it real? To me, that's very exciting.? Parents of children with epilepsy have become the most effective advocates for marijuana law reform at every level. Consequently, in a very short time frame, laws legalizing cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant, have passed in 16 states, mostly in the south and southeast: Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and, yes, South Carolina. The problem is that most of these laws provide little access to actual CBD because marijuana is still classified as a highly addictive drug with no medical benefit. So the state laws, in some cases, have made matters worse by providing false hope for the parents of sick children, a problem the CARERS Act aims to solve. ?When you ask if it is still illegal under federal law,it almost a trick question,? said Jill Swing, a South Carolina resident and mother of a child affected by a disease that is treatable with CBD. ?Currently the federal government is in conflict with itself. The Federal Farming Act of 2014 allows for cultivation of hemp?.That being said, all forms of cannabis, including hemp, are considered Schedule I controlled substances by the DEA. That is why the CBD component of the CARERS Act is so important.?It parents like Swing who helped educate Graham on the importance of CBD, and legalizing CBD has become sort of an entry-level course for former drug warriors who are now inching toward drug policy reform. Even Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and longtimeb noire of marijuana advocates, made an appearance atGraham subcommittee hearing in July to express his support for legalizing CBD. But he made sure to limit his support to juvenile epileptics and ?children who suffer from these rare conditions.? In essence, he was acknowledging the medical benefit of marijuana but reserving the right to determine which sick people deserve access to that medicine.Graham open-mindedness on the issue goes back to an experience with his own mother, whose death he wrote about in an autobiography he released in the run-up to his presidential campaign. In My Story, a 126-page e-book available on his website, Graham relates in gripping detail his motherMillie battle with stage IVHodgkin lymphoma, her quick wasting, how the doctors pronounced her dead, and how Lindsey rushed to her bedside and revived her, if only for a few days. His mother, 56, told him, ""Lindsey, let me go.? After a week, during which the 21-year-old college student witnessed his mother convulse with seizures, Graham, fighting back tears, told his mother: ?Okay, let go.We be fine. Let go.? ?She smiled at me,? Graham wrote, ?and died five minutes later.? The book never delves into whether marijuana might have helped his mother (she died in 1976, decades before the debate would emerge so publicly), but the anecdote is just the kind of experience that could cause even a lobbyist-besieged senator to empathize with cancer survivors evangelizing the benefits of medical marijuana. So, I asked Graham ifthat what happened with him. ?Absolutely,? he said, without hesitation. ?I mean,chemotherapy kill you to make you better. And people who go through chemo treatment go through hell. If there's an application of the marijuana plant that can help patients like that? I know they need all the help they can get. I just want to make sure we do it based on science, but that is a worthy goal....Sign me up.? *** ButGraham voteshaven always matched his thinking on the issue. It took some gentle nudging from Don Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, to getGraham votes to reflect his rhetoric. It was the morning of June 11, 2015, when Murphy said he caught Graham in the hallway before Graham went into a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee to vote. Graham asked Murphy, ?How you doing?? And Murphy seized the opening. ?Well, that depends on how you vote on my amendment.? ?Well, what amendment is that?? ?It?s the medical marijuana amendment,? Murphy recalls telling Graham, ?andI read thatyou made certain positive statements about the states making these decisions and patients making these decisions, and I hope your vote reflects your previous statements.? Indeed, in February 2014, Graham had told WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina: ??when it comes to medicinal marijuana and this [CBD] oil, I think politicians should embrace what makes sense?.This is about families with sick children.? In effect, Graham was making favorable statements for more than a year before Murphy grabbed him in the hallway. He justwasn voting that way. Murphy reminded him of this, he said, eliciting polite nods from Graham as the senator clutched the doorknob of the committee room before disappearing inside.Murphy amendment, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), aimed at restricting federal law enforcement from meddling with state-legal medical marijuana programs. It passed the Senate Appropriations Committee that day by a vote of 21-9, with eight Republicans in favor. At the end of the meeting, Murphy was ecstatic, shaking hands and thanking members, but then he was disappointed to see that Graham had voted no by proxy. Later that day, while roaming the halls on the second floor of the Russell Office Building, Murphy said he just happened to bump into Graham and a staffer as they left his office. Graham was holding a laundered shirt on a hanger, which impressed Murphy because Grahamhadn delegated that chore to his staffer. ?How you doing?? Graham asked Murphy, recognizing him from earlier. ?Well,I be doing better if, you know, I thoughtI get your vote.? ?What do you mean?? Graham said. ?You voted no by proxy."" Graham looked at his staffer and said, ?I did?? And the staffer said, ?Yeah, you did.? In long committee meetings, it's not uncommon for a member to step out for a few minutes and for a staffer seated behind the member to indicate with a head nod to the chair how the member intended to vote for a particular amendment. In this case, Graham's staffer guessed incorrectly. ?What!?? Graham said. ?Ididn want to do that!? And right there, Graham pulled out his flip phone and called the clerk to change his vote, but it was too late. From that moment on, Graham was thinking about the issue in a new way. About six months later, Murphy was in New Hampshire lobbying presidential candidates for the Marijuana Policy Project and he bumped into Graham at a Jeb Bush rally, just a few weeks after Graham had suspended his own campaign. Graham came up to Murphy and told him, ?I?m on that bill!??meaning the CARERS Act, which caught Murphy off-guard becauseit his job to know these things. He went back to his hotel that night and looked it up on his laptop anddidn seeGraham name listed as a co-sponsor, so the next day he hunted Graham down and found him at another Jeb rally. ?Senator, respectfully, Idon see your name on there,? Murphy said. ?It?s on there! I promise you,it on there!? Graham insisted. For whatever bureaucratic reason,Graham namewasn officially added to the co-sponsor list until March 10, a month after the New Hampshire primary. *** On July 13, 6? months after Graham withdrew from the presidential race and six months after he saw Don Murphy in New Hampshire, Graham chaired theSenate first-ever hearing on medical marijuana. Murphy was sitting in the gallery. About an hour into the hearing, Graham shuffled through his papers, found what he was looking for, and holding it up, he said, ?Idon mean to advertise for this guy, but Dr. Reefer??displaying a photo of a pot leaf-emblazoned billboard for a Las Vegas-area business that provides medical marijuana cards to qualifying residents. ?He has a billboard. I think this is in Las Vegas,"" Graham said, eliciting enough laughs from the gallery to wake the room up. Graham entered Dr. Reefer into the record to demonstrate that some states? medical marijuana programs ?have not gone down the scientific route,? and he called Dr. Reefer a prime example of a bad actor using medical marijuana as a fig leaf to cover, inGraham words, ?de facto backdoor legalization? of marijuana for recreational use. For Graham, the medical marijuana issue is a spectrum: On one end are the juvenile epileptics who need CBD, who he supports without reservation, and on the other end is Dr. Reefer, an operation that Graham sees as making a mockery of medical marijuana in order to legitimize criminal activity. During his hearing, practically in real time, it appeared Graham was trying to determine where along that spectrum he felt comfortable landing. Graham was introduced to the problem of Dr. Reefer by Miriam Adelson, a medical doctor and an addiction researcher who is also the wife of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. ?They said, 'This is not what you want,?? Graham tells POLITICO Magazine. ?And I got a bunch of stuff from California, too. But the Dr. Reefer was just too easy, so I chose him.? A lawmaker looking for clarity on this issueisn likely to get much help from the Adelsons, who have taken seemingly contradictory positions on medical marijuana. The Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation studies medical marijuana in its facility in Tel Aviv, but just two years ago, in 2014, Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific donors to conservative causes, gave the anti-medical marijuana campaign in Florida $5.5 million. The Las Vegas Review Journal flipped its editorial position on marijuana from pro to con after Adelson purchased the newspaper. In September, the Adelsons reinforced their commitment to fight medical marijuana with an additional $1 million to fight legalization in Florida. ?The Adelsons are strong opponents of medical marijuana,? says Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment from POLITICO Magazine. Craig Moon, publisher of the Review Journal , replied in an email, ?the editorial board reports to me, I believe that Nevadans should vote no on the recreational marijuana amendment. The Adelson family also shares my view.? Dr. Reefer is not a real person;it a business thatdoesn grow or sell any marijuana. Since it opened in 2001, it charges patients a fee and provides them with a medical card that allows them to purchase marijuana legally at separate establishments. It was founded by a three-time felon who ran afoul of federal authorities in 2010, when he was caught overstepping the bounds of Dr.Reefer business model by selling marijuana directly to clients. Dr. Reefer continues its busy referral business with its provocative brand name under new ownership (whose identities are difficult to determine). ?As for the billboards,it nothing new,? says Derek Sante, spokesman for Dr. Reefer. ?Those billboards have been up for more than a decade.? Although advocates like Don Murphy have no love for the Adelsons (?It?s heartless to support making criminals out of cancer patients, and that's what Adelsons' position does?), Murphy concedes that operations like Dr. Reefer remain an obstacle to his work. ?Look,he not wrong,? Murphy said, referring to Graham. ?The nonsense that went on in California for years has made it very difficult for those of us who are advocating for legitimate medical marijuana patients.? But Murphy goes on to connect the dots between bad state law and a paralyzed Congress: ?California happens because legislatorsdon do their jobs.? ?So, anyway,? Murphy said, bringing it back around to the CARERS Act hearing in July. ?I?m real happy with Lindsey Graham.? Like many activists who sat throughGraham historic Senate hearing, Murphy left that day feeling like Graham meant business. ?I do mean business,? Graham told POLITICO Magazine. ?Sen. Graham has gone above and beyond,? says Murphy. ?He justdidn put his name on it [the CARERS Act], he actually held a hearing. And I give him major props for that, and the hearing was pretty fair.? ?What we're doing today is not enough,? Graham said of the federal drug-law status quo. ?We need to do more, and I just want to make sure that what we do doesn't get us to legitimizing the Dr. Reefers of the world.? On August 11, the DEA refused to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to the less-severe Schedule II, as the CARERS bill would do, but did promise to accept applications for licensed growing operations in order to improve access to research-quality marijuana. Itdidn indicate how many applications it would approve. (Graham has not responded to requests for comment regarding theDEA decision.) Unless something changes in the lame-duck session, the likelihood the CARERS Act gets a vote in this Congress remains close to zero; the fight over Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is all the Senate Judiciary Committee is focused on. While the CARERS Act's progress is historic, it's still just a marijuana bill on Capitol Hill. And the lame-duck session could indeed follow a landslide of state-level marijuana victories that could rattle even the most steadfast drug-war loyalist. Medical marijuana will be on the ballot in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota, while full Colorado-style legalization will be on the ballot in California, Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada, where voters could render Dr. Reefer and his ""de facto legalization"" scheme beside the point. But Don Murphy of MPP is having a field day with it. He tells all the Republican lawmakers in states where it's on the ballot: ""I bet you marijuana gets more votes than you do.""

"Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide. Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a ?wounded country? that ?looks bad to the world.? Pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to healAmerica racial divide. Story Continued Below ?Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,? Trump said. ?America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, andwe had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.? He called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a ?national crisis.? He also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing ?the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers? and sympathized with police officers, who carry an ?immense responsibility? but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot atObama leadership, or lack thereof. ?We all have to walk a mile in someoneelse shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean,it ? we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,? Trump said. ?Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be theworld leader. How can we lead when wecan even control our own cities?? Trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45thpresident responsibility ?to address this crisis and save African-American lives,? has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign. Trump's overtures to black voters ? often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences ? have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that ?drugs are a very, very big factor? in what's happening in Charlotte. Still, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with ?Fox and Friends,? the Republican presidential nominee said there ?just seems thatthere a lack of spirit between the white and the black.? ?I mean,it a terrible thing thatwe witnessing,? he continued. ?You?re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte ? a great place ? and you just see it.? Protests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte. By Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys forScott family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of thefamily lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth."" Justin Bamberg, another of thefamilyattorney, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that ?pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.? He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed thatScott wife was present when he was shot. ?At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,? Bamberg said when asked why thefamily legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. ?Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.? The Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the difficultiesher home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. ?I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,? she said. ?But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.? White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully. ?Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,? he said. ?We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.? Wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said. ?I see it even going out.There such a lack of ?there a lack of spirit,? Trump said. ?There?s a lack of something.Something going onthat bad, andwhat going on between police and others is getting worse.? The real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot. ?Well,it wow, here we go again,? Trump said. ?It?s very sad. When you look atwhat going on,it very sad.It very divided, our country, andit getting worse.I not overly surprised to see it, butit happening.? Trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they servewon solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more. ?If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,? Trump said. ?And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was ? that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, butthere something deeper than that.?What necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking fromAmerica current leader. ?Well, it really has to be ? you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, andthere no unity,? Trump said. ?You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening.It so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean,it so sad to see. Butthere just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.? But what Trumpdidn say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammedObama lack of leadership. ?First of all,it a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years afterwe had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I thinkthat a tragic failure of leadership,? Gingrich said. ?But my guess is he was afraidit make him a black president in a narrowing sense,? he added. ?He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.? Giuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to lastFriday shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was ?a more difficult situation? than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the ?ambiguous, troubling category.? ?But even there, you gotta say to people, ?Wait, let the investigation play out.? The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,? Giuliani said. ?The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.?",0.037903226,0.015322581,0.008870968,0.010483871,0.071774194,0.305645161,0,2,-1,1

Palmer, widely regarded as one ofgolf greatest stars, died Sunday in Pittsburgh at the age of 87. He won seven major tournaments over the course of his career, including four Masters Tournaments, and 65 wins on the PGA Tour rank him 5th all-time on that list.

"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012. And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ?Islamic State? in Iraq and Syria.? ObviouslyObama dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a JVteam and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error. However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi. And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports. However whatisn in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

"Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the birtherissue,there one pro-Trump surrogate who ? in the tightest re-election fight of his life ? is still pledging to continue his investigation into PresidentObama birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain BarackObama birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: ?I?m not going to give up, andwe looking into it. Idon know howit going to turn out. Idon care wherehe from. We are looking at a forged document. Period. I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.? The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized byArpaio pledge to unleash the ?truth.? Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him stuckwith the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case and commander ofArpaio Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knewTrump statement was a ?punch in the gut, because it was unexpected.? Zullo said he thoughtTrump statement was ?strategic.? ?It?s not going to deter us,? Zullo said. ?It?s not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.? Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened.

"Huma Abedin dumped her then-husband Anthony Weiner when it was revealed that he had carried on a sexting relationship with another woman ? one of many ? in which he had sent a risqu? picture of himself, and in the picture, he was accompanied by his young son. But unbeknownst to his then-wife and the rest of the world ? but certainly not surprisingly ? he was carrying on another relationship during this time with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. From January to July, he sent photos and vulgar texts to her.I let the New York Post fill you in on the dirty details: The 15-year-old high school student went public with a trove of lurid come-ons she got from Weiner, who exchanged his ?Carlos Danger? persona for the alias ?T Dog? to send her kinky texts and shirtless selfies over a cell-phone messenger app. Weiner repeatedly told the unidentified teen how hardand horny he was, at one point boasting that after sex with him she would, ?limp for a week,? the Daily Mail reported. Weiner ? whose serial sexting cost him his seat in Congress and a comeback bid for mayor ? also shared pornographic videos with her, asked her to get naked and masturbate for him over Skype, and even told her about ?rape fantasies? that grossed her out. [?] The girl said Weiner tried to cover up the sexual nature of their relationship by pressuring her to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided, ?and tell them what I said was false.? Even liberal Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo is disgusted with Weiner. ?If the reports are true,it possibly criminal and it is sick,? he said. ?And frankly,I heard enough about Anthony Weiner, and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.? If Weiner is charged at the federal level with sexual exploitation of children, it carries with it a minimum of 15 years in prison, and a maximum of 30 years. At the state level, disseminating indecent material and promoting the sexual performance of a child could each get him 7 years in jail. In response, Weiner said that he has ?likely been the subject of a hoax,? but as the Post pointed out, hedidn deny any of the allegations against him. In a prepared statement, Weiner said, ?I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement [sic] about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.

"Hillary Clinton has a 9-point advantage over Donald Trump. | AP Photo Poll: Clinton leads Trump in New Hampshire Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in thenation smallest battleground state, according to a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters in New Hampshire released on Wednesday. The poll, which was conducted last Saturday through Tuesday, shows Clinton with a 9-point advantage over Trump, 47 percent to 38 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 10 percent, Green Party nominee Jill Stein garners 1 percent, and another 3 percent of likely voters are undecided. New Hampshire will only award 4 electoral votes this fall. But the state has outsized importance in the battle for the Senate, and the Monmouth poll shows incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte with a slim, 2-point lead over her Democratic challenger, popular Gov. Maggie Hassan, 47 percent to 45 percent. That is well within thepoll margin of error: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. And Republicans also have an early lead in thegovernor race, after both parties selected their nominees in lastweek primaries. Republican Chris Sununu leads his relatively unknown Democratic opponent, Colin Van Ostern, 49 percent to 43 percent. In the presidential race, Clinton leads Trump because more Democrats (94 percent) have lined up behind the former secretary of state than Republicans (85 percent) who are supporting Trump. Clinton also leads among independents, 42 percent to 35 percent. Neither Clinton nor Trump is popular, butTrump negatives outweighClinton. Thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Clinton, while 56 percent view her unfavorably.Trump favorable rating is lower: 30 percent favorable, compared to 63 percent unfavorable. It's another in a series of polls this week that show Clinton regaining some momentum after losing ground last week amid the fallout of her ""basket of deplorables"" comment and pneumonia diagnosis. Monmouth has also showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points in vote-rich Florida, and within striking distance in Georgia, which has been reliably Republican in recent elections. Both candidates in the Senate race are well liked: Half of likely voters approve of how Ayotte is handling her job as senator, and 38 percent disapprove.Hassan approval rating is even higher: Sixty percent approve of the second-termgovernor job performance, and only 31 percent disapprove. Neither candidate in the gubernatorial race is well known, but Sununu ? whose father, John, served three terms as governor in the 1980s, and brother, also named John, served a term in the Senate last decade ? has higher name ID. Thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Sununu, 22 percent view him unfavorably, and 41 percent have no opinion of the Republican. But Van Ostern is little known: Twenty-eight percent view him favorably, and only 6 percent have an unfavorable opinion. But roughly 2-in-3 voters, 66 percent, have no opinion of the Democratic nominee. The poll surveyed 400 likely voters.",0.007772021,0.005181347,0,0,0.028497409,0.222797927,0.010362694,2,-1,1

" Secretary of State John Kerry launched a blistering attack on Russia Wednesday for its actions in Syria, pointing to the bombing of a UN aid convoy that left more than 20 dead and its inability to stop continued Syrian air attacks. Kerry spoke immediately after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York about the five-year Syrian war. ""I listened to my colleague from Russia and I sort of felt like we're in a parallel universe here,"" Kerry said of their differing accounts of the conflict. He called for all planes in key areas of Syria to be immediately grounded and for countries to stop supporting those who sabotage ceasefire efforts. Kerry also questioned how the US-supported opposition can engage in political talks to resolve the conflict when the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, doesn't halt its attacks. Russia was tasked with restraining Syria during this latest attempt at a ceasefire, undertaken last week. ""How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity,"" Kerry asked. ""You're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in Geneva while the regime drops bombs?"" Russian denial The diplomatic clashing of swords highlights just how hard it has been to take even the first steps toward calming the Syrian conflict enough to begin political talks. The ongoing civil war has given terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda fertile recruiting ground, has sucked in regional powers seeking influence over the outcome and has sent ripples through Europe and its allies. JUST WATCHED Aid convoy attacked in Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Aid convoy attacked in Syria 02:45 As diplomats sparred at the Security Council, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said that Moscow was sending an aircraft cruiser to the Mediterranean to strengthen its capabilities there. The Russians have denied that they were behind the attack on the UN convoy and instead have offered a series of explanations that Kerry detailed at the Security Council meeting.. Russia initially said that the strike was a necessary response to an alleged offensive by an al-Qaeda-linked terror group, Kerry said. Then Russia claimed they were bombing elsewhere, then that the aid convoy had been followed by militants with mortars, and then that the trucks caught fire. ""The trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted,"" Kerry said. ""Anybody here believe that?"" he asked. The bombing attacks on hospitals and children are ""flagrant violations of international law,"" he added. And attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers continue, Kerry noted. He cited separate air strikes on Monday that killed four aid workers near Aleppo. ""There are only two countries that have planes that are flying during the night or flying in that particular area at all,"" Kerry said. ""They are Russia and Syria."" 'Thorough and impartial' investigation At the Security Council Wednesday, Lavrov said Russia always put as a top priority the resumption of the inter-Syrian political dialogue without any preconditions. And he called for a ""thorough and impartial"" investigation into Monday's bombing, which left the convoy of trucks in a twisted wreck of smoking metal. And he urged his counterparts at the meeting to ""refrain from emotional comments."" US officials have fingered Russia as the perpetrator of the attack based on intelligence and reports from the ground. Kerry cited eyewitnesses who said that ""all of a sudden, the place became hell and the fighter jets were in the sky."" The White House said publicly Tuesday night that it held Russians responsible, regardless of whether it or the Syrian government had launched the strikes, since they have responsibility for the airspace. ""We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashaar Jaafari hit back, saying it was ""laughable"" for Kerry to cite eyewitness accounts when, he claimed, ""thousands of people"" in the area hadn't seen any jets. He also took the US to task for an airstrike on Satruday that killed 62 Syrian soldiers, calling it a ""deliberate and unacceptable aggression."" The US has said it was an accident. JUST WATCHED Syrian Observatory: Russian airstrikes kill 23 people Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Syrian Observatory: Russian airstrikes kill 23 people 01:48 Kerry's scathing 28-minute speech to the Security Council also pressed the need to return to a 2012 plan to create a political transition in Syria. He pointed to repeated Syrian attacks on civilians, detailed shifting Russian explanations about the aid convoy attack and ridiculed Moscow's argument that political talks shouldn't be burdened with preconditions. The US has said that Russia bears responsibility for the attack on the convoy because they were the only two countries flying planes over the area at that time and Russia had pledged to restrain Syria. ""The primary question is no longer what do we know,"" Kerry said. ""The primary question is, collectively, what are we going to do about it? In other words, this is a moment of truth."" Washington, Moscow clash Lavrov needled the US over opposition groups during his address. Washington and Moscow have clashed over Russian targeting of moderate Syrian opposition groups backed by the US. The Russians have claimed that some of these groups are not particularly moderate and have accused opposition groups of violating the ceasefire. On Wednesday, Lavrov called for all members of the International Syrian Support Group to ensure that the opposition groups over which they have influence will comply with the cessation of hostilities. Otherwise, he added, ""We can't preserve Syria as a single, united state."" And he alluded to ""geopolitical engineering,"" a reference to Russian concerns about US attempts at ""regime change."" Syria's Jaafari echoed the argument, telling the meeting that the International Syrian Support Group was ""formed outside international legitimacy"" and was ""reminiscent of other destructive coalitions that only brought disasters to countries like Iraq and Libya and Yemen."" The only success the US has managed to achieve, Jaafari said, is to level ""false accusations"" about the ""suffering of Syrians to demonize the Syrian government and its allies."" Four failed ceasefires Kerry had left the meeting before the Syrian ambassador spoke, but when Jaafari had finished speaking, Ambassador Michele Sison, the US deputy representative to the UN, asked to address the council. ""My colleagues are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts,"" Sison said. ""Let's just keep in mind just who is prolonging the suffering of the people of Syria."" Jaafari's remarks had been ""so full of untruths that I feel no need to say anything further,"" she said. For his part, earlier in the meeting, Kerry mocked Lavrov's argument that there should be no preconditions before political negotiations start. Citing four international-level agreements calling for a cessation of hostilities that could then lead to peace talks, Kerry said, ""that's not a precondition. That's an international agreement, four times arrived at."" ""Four times, it's been shredded by independent actors,"" Kerry said, ""by spoilers who don't want a cease-fire."" Half of Syria's population has been uprooted, many of them fleeing to Europe, and well over 300,000 men, women and children have been killed, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the meeting. ""Those who believe the crisis in Syria cannot become even worse are dead wrong,"" Kerry said, ""as are those who believe there's a military solution.""",0.031180401,0.004454343,0.005567929,0.006681514,0.059020045,0.266146993,0.002227171,2,-1,1
"Obama wears hat, breaking ?Politics 101? rule on headgear President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference. The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the NavalAcademy football team, which presented him with one of its helmets. ?Here?s the general rule: Youdon put stuff on your head ifyou president,?

"DonaldTrump lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston. Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump ? so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is andisn. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is ? adding another layer of deceit and fraud toTrump already horrendous track record. The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes throughTrump bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the businessmogul court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, ?even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.? The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: ?The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up.? Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut feelingsand ?emotional state? to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how nutsit was, and imitatedTrump strategy: ?By the way,I having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.? Johnston has been trying to get America to believe thatTrump billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement byTrump bankers said that the GOPnominee net worth was actually negative $295 million. Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trumpisn as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is ?no evidence that he is a billionaire.?

"Forrest Lucas? nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry. | AP Photo Sources: Oil executive on Trump's short list for Interior Secretary An oil industry executive who has spoken out against animal rights is a leading contender for Interior secretary should Donald Trump win the White House, two sources familiar with thecampaign deliberations told POLITICO on Monday ? a prospect that drew immediate condemnation from environmental activists. Forrest Lucas, the 74-year-old co-founder of oil products company Lucas Oil, is well-known in his native Indiana, where in 2006 he won the naming rights to Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team, for a reported $121.5 million over 20 years. He and his wife have given a combined $50,000 to the gubernatorial campaigns of Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, according to Indiana state records. Story Continued Below Lucas? company, California-based Lucas Oil, is a fast-growing manufacturer of automotive oils, lubricants and other additives used in everything from cars to heavy-duty trucks. One person briefed by the Trump campaign said Lucas is a ?front-runner? for the Interior secretary job. The person, who was granted anonymity to talk about private discussions, added that Trump wants a ?more business-friendly and business experience-heavy cabinet.? But environmentalists quickly excoriated the idea of an oil industry executive leading the department that oversees national parks and wildlife refuges, along with decisions about offshore drilling, fracking regulations and protections for endangered species. ""Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump's promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he's elected,"" said Khalid Pitts, the Sierra Club's national political director. David Turnbull, the campaigns director at anti-fossil-fuels group Oil Change USA, worried that Trump's Cabinet could be full of people with ties to the oil industry. They include Harold Hamm, the CEO of Oklahoma oil company Continental Resources, who has emerged as a possible pick for Trump's energy secretary. ""Catering to an industry dead-set on continued expansion of oil and gas drilling is not only totally out of step with climate science, but it's also out of step with the majority of Americans who are calling for a swift transition to clean energy and robust action on climate change,"" Turnbull said in an email. It would be nearly unprecedented for major oil executive to get the top job in the Interior Department. Current Secretary Sally Jewell was an engineer for Mobil Oil early in her career and often touts her experience fracking wells, although she is best known as a conservationist and former outdoor retail executive. Lucas? nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry, which has battled President BarackObama Interior Department for years over everything from Endangered Species Act listings to access to federal lands for drilling. Trump has cultivated close ties to the oil industry, which was once skeptical of his campaign for president. ""In a lot of ways, having an oil and gas friendly person in the Interior Department is more important to the oil and gas industry than having someone friendly at the Energy Department,"" one industry official said. Nominating Lucas would also break with the long-standing tradition of Interior secretaries coming from Western states. It would also likely draw rebukes from animal rights groups. Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves onTrump agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent ?anti-conservation zealots.? Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter, has also publicly expressed interest in the job. Earlier this year, Lucas financed and produced a feature film called ?The Dog Lover,? which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as being unfairly targeted by animal rights groups. The movie was backed by Protect the Harvest, a nonprofit founded and chaired by Lucas, that saysit ?Keeping America Free, Fed & Fun!? In 2014, Lucas gave $250,000 to the Protect the Harvest PAC, records show. Roger Ebert's website called the movie ?shamelessly manipulative? and ?a pretty bald piece of anti-[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] and/or PETA propaganda,? noting that the movie ends with a call to moviegoers to look into animal welfare groups before donating to them. Animal rights supporters were quick to point out Monday that Lucas had put up hundreds of thousands of dollars into fighting an ""anti-puppy mill"" ballot measure in Missouri that was approved by voters in 2010. ""Forrest Lucas is a peevish advocate of trophy hunting, puppy mills and big agribusiness, and has never met a case of animal exploitation hewouldn defend,"" said Michael Markarian, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, which backed the measure in Missouri. Lucas? wife, Charlotte, who co-founded Lucas Oil, came under fire in 2014 for a Facebook post that criticized Muslims and atheists. ""I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!? she wrote, according to news reports at the time. She later apologized. Lucas has donated more than $150,000 to a slew of Republican candidates and causes since 2006, but records do not show any donations to Trump. In an interview last year, Lucas did not sound particularly enthused about the New York City real estate mogul. Asked if he would be comfortable with Trump getting the GOP nomination, Lucas responded: ?It would be like when Obama got elected.I say, ?Idon really like it, but I have no choice andI have to make the best of it.?? A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Lucas could not immediately be reached and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"NASCAR officials have been working hard for a couple weeks now on how they really ant post race inspections to look.We seenNASCAR Executive Vice President, SteveO, speak out several times over the matter of post race inspections and howhe like them to go. Basically, he wants the attention off of that aspect of things so estate everyone can focus on good racing. So in order for that to happen,O and the rest of the executives have changed the format a bit, as we all know by now! They cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree. However, executives realize that this may give drivers some leeway for cheating tactics. And SteveO is trying to nip that in the bud. In a meeting this past weekend at New Hampshire, he made himself very clear as to what their expectations from the drivers were. ?I want to make clear to everybody here that inNASCAR judgment, any measures that are taken to circumvent what happens for postrace inspection, we are going to react. We knowthat subjective. But ask all of you not to put it in our hands because we will react if we have to. I think everybody knows what that means. We want to concentrate on the race. ? Wecouldn be more clear. I hope everybody agrees with that.?It awesome to see the officials making themselves clear and being open about their expectations!We see how open they are in the future however, seeing thatOdidn clarify what cheating was in their books.

"As my 25th wedding anniversary approached, I tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s werelarge until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others. ?Oh, the Panic of 1857,? the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. ?It was really bad. The presidentdidn seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.? Story Continued Below Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibilitythat the winneris or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country. But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainlywon rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was.I made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at,let say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historicalplaques the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surelywouldn be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible. Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man. Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one ofAmerica great financial downturns. For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent. Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items fromabroad wanted to stimulate foreigntrade made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive. Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled. Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good. Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate. Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional. Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicatethat that he would be all for whatever the court decided. Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force. Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in thecourt history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for thecountry not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it. As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy. Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything heowned stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless. Every bank in New York City effectivelyclosed would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co. Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets. The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity. Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.Buchanan response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and ?deserved thegambler fate.? Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times. In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back. Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid. In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary WilliamWalker forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm thenonfatal to onepig. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be. As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plaindidn like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election. The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim betweenLincoln election and his inauguration in March, thus underBuchanan watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it. As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinetmembers had a lot of Southernallies refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold. Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter. Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms? speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the ?Worst. President. Ever,? there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb. Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ?08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen.

Trump is the next President of the United States. But instead of reaching for your passport and booking an extended vacation to another country, consider what University of Utah law professor Christopher L. Peterson had to say in a paper he just published: Even if he were elected,there enough evidence already in the matter of Trump University to impeach the Orange Menace before he even raises his hand and takes the oath of office. Peterson writes: ?In the United States, it is illegal for businesses to use false statements to convince consumers to purchase their services. The evidence indicates that Trump University used a systemic pattern of fraudulent representations to trick thousands of families into investing in a program that can be argued was a sham. ?Fraud and racketeering are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts.? Continue reading below the advertisement In the paper, which is titled Trump University and Presidential Impeachment, Professor Peterson also notes: ?Somehow in the cacophony of the 2016 presidential campaign, no legal academic has yet turned to the question of whetherTrump alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the impeachment clause of the United States Constitution.? So instead of taking up residence at the White House, Trump could instead be facing a trial in the Senate and another in federal court which could well wind up result in him having to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the very people he cheated with his bogus university. And if he were found guilty of racketeering, Trump could even be sent to federal prison where he belongs. Hey, Donald:Don get too excited on election night.

"Posted by John Prager on 21 Sep 2016 On Wednesday, talk show legend Montel Williams posed a very simple question for conservatives: when are you going to take responsibility for their role in helping to create the violent situation in Charlotte, North Carolina? Just hours after Donald Trump proposed nationwide ?Stop and Frisk? ? a policy that was declared unconstitutional in New York. Responding to a question about ?black-on-black crime,? Trump said he would ?do stop-and-frisk? to solve the problem. ?We did it in New York,? he said. ?It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive.? Stop-and-frisk did not, in fact, ?work incredibly well.? In 2011, for example, black and Latino residents made up about 90 percent of people stopped, and 88 percent of those were innocent. Even in predominantly white neighborhoods, blacks and Latinos were stopped more than whites. ?Donald Trump is having trouble with the facts,? New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said in a statement regardingTrump remarks. ?Stop and frisk as it was applied in New York City was unconstitutional, itdidn reduce crime and it severely corroded the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.? Yes, ?stop-and-frisk? is a racist practice, but his suggestion that it should be implemented nationwide really resonates with some ofTrump die-hard supporters ? namely white supremacists. ?When are conservatives going to own their damn part in this? That asshole Trump just proposed national stop and frisk?? Williams, who has also been critical of protesters who have chosen to become violent, asked on Twitter. ?WTF??

"Washington  The first presidential debate broke viewing records Monday, but a number of key Senate Republicans getting grilled over Donald Trump's Miss Universe comments say they either weren't watching or don't have an opinion on one of the night's signature moments. ""I didn't get to see it. I was traveling back from Utah. Stupid plane wouldn't let us tie into CNN. So I felt bad about that. I'm going to talk to them,"" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. ""I didn't see it guys, I was on an airplane,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Trump's former GOP primary rivals, told reporters. Sen. Ted Cruz, who only fully embraced Trump last Friday, didn't want to talk to reporters. ""We put out a statement last night,"" he told CNN, as he ran into the Senate chamber. Those who claimed to missed the debate had it the easiest. As they have all year long, GOP lawmakers have been in a bind as they were forced to confront the latest controversial statement from Trump. Tuesday, the questions were about the debate and his comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Hillary Clinton placed his comments blasting former Machado for putting on too much weight front and center Monday night, and Trump fueled the fire Tuesday morning on Fox News. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said Monday night. ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" But GOP lawmakers who praised Trump's debate performance ducked questions about Machado. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the Machado and Trump's debate performance, he limited his answer to just: ""On the debate, I thought he did just fine."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has openly criticized Trump's remarks he viewed as racist, refused to engage on Machado: ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it."" Dodging questions about Trump has become old hat inside the Capitol, since Trump first broke through the field of Republican candidates, and then fought his way to the nomination. Trump's accusation that the judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit was impartial because he was ""Mexican"" (the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is from Indiana) -- left lawmakers in a similar lurch this past June. The Trump answers have become almost perfunctory, based on Tuesday's informal survey. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats: ""No comment."" Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander: ""No comment."" Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tough battle to hold his seat, repeatedly said, ""Not going to talk about it."" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was one of the only Republicans to weigh in on Trump's Miss Universe comment: ""Well, those are comments I don't agree with."" Other lawmakers had effusive praise for Trump when asked broadly about the debate, but little to say on the specifics. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito explained that she had been listening to the debate in the car and thought Trump did an excellent job. But when asked about Trump's Miss Universe comments, she said she must have missed that part. Sen.

Yapias, 50, known as Adolfo Tony Yapias-Delgado, was formally charged in the 3rd District Monday with rape, a first-degree felony and evidence tampering, a class A misdemeanor. Yapias is the director of Proyecto Latino de Utah. Nomeans ?no?, even in Spanish, Antonio! According to court documents Yapias went to thewoman home in South Salt Lake on March 21. ?The victim had terminated the relationship 10 days prior and had expressed strongly and repeatedly in text messages that the relationship was over and she did not want anything to do with the defendant,? court documents state. Documents indicate that Yapias persisted and went to her home. ??Thevictim last text to the defendant, before he arrived at her home said: ?I said no.don you get it.? The defendant responded with a series of three text messages as follows: ?No, Idon get it,? then ?I?ll be there? followed a short time later by ?I?m here,?? It appears Yapiaswasn concerned about any borders or rights of people not to be harassed.Let see if the Liberals can figure out a way to make a poster child out of this monster.",0.025380711,0.010152284,0.010152284,0.005076142,0.055837563,0.304568528,0.015228426,2,-1,1
" Famed economist and former labor secretary Robert Reich posted an interaction he recently had with a Trump supporter that demonstrates just how deeply this ridiculous misconception that Donald Trump is a ?good businessman? has sunk into the public consciousness. Businessmen only care about one thing ? their profits, and increasing those profits. A nation-state is not a business, nor should it be run like one. The leader of a nation-state must care for the well-being of his people and balancing complex international relationships with other nation-states, concerns thatdon have anything to do with the single-minded obsession with profit. And of course, Trump is not a good businessman. He started out with a ?small loan? of just a million dollars after being handed all the opportunities a straight white male needs to make it in America. He then lied, cheated and extorted his way to the top, and still managed to rack up four bankruptcies and over 3500 lawsuits. He is nothing but a con-man, andhe about to run our country into the ground just likehe done to his businesses.

"Story highlights Ivanka Trump will be attending a roundtable hosted by Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Trump will hear about the issues GOP House members and Senators are working on in Congress Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters. The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office. Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias. Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.

"The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works for David Axelrod. Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) Despite improving poll numbers, Donald Trump still faces the political equivalent of pulling an inside straight if he is to succeed to the presidency, says Karl Rove, mastermind behind both of President George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. ""Democrats have an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes than Republicans,"" Rove told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. That advantage makes Hillary Clinton the continued front-runner in the race headed into next week's critical first debate, Rove said. ""He's got to win all the Romney states, and as you know, three of them are up for grabs -- North Carolina, he's behind; Arizona, Georgia, barely ahead. He's got to win Florida, got to win Ohio, but that only gets him to 253. He's got to find another 17, and I think he'll win Nevada, I think he'll win Iowa, but even then that only gets him to 265. And that last five, he's got to win either New Hampshire and the second district of Maine, or Pennsylvania, or Michigan, or Wisconsin."" Rove, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, is a chairman of the Crossroads super PAC, which has thus far refused to deploy its significant resources on Trump's behalf, focusing instead on preserving Republican control of the United States Senate. The GOP entered the year in an uphill battle for the Senate, with six Republican incumbents running for reelection in blue states President Obama carried in 2012. Democrats must seize five seats, or win four and the presidency, to wrest control of the upper chamber away from the GOP.

"When reading an article like this, think of manmade global warming? Government funding of scientific research has a corrupting influence that could cause more unethical behavior among researchers, according to a new study by scientists at Virginia Tech. Researchers found federal funding is encouraging scientists to falsify data and publish bad research. The study found that universities are making the problem worse by mostly hiring young scientists as adjuncts, not tenure-track positions, which increases the financial pressures causing them to distort science. ?Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself,? Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy, researchers at Virginia Tech, wrote in their study. Edwards was the scientist who helped expose that the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) top Midwest official knew about the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis months before telling the public. ?Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from allsources combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior,? they wrote. Government funding of research produces enormous financial incentives for scientists to engage in dubious laboratory research. Academics are under serious financial pressure to rapidly and continually publish research to sustain or further their careers, even if the research is essentially useless or misleading. Even major scientific journals like Nature are asking ?Is Science Broken?? ?The first problem are that the government provides monopoly funding for fields which are related to regulatory efforts, and much of that funding is spent with a foregone conclusion in mind,? Dr. Pat Michaels, the Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute who was not involved in the study, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. ?Wedon fund billions and billions of dollars of climate research each year to find that global warmingisn a problem. Politics has intruded into the scientific process.? Due to this monopoly, scientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results seem significant or to align with government priorities. A growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions, especially among social scientists. Polling indicates that such consequences are causing science itself to become less trusted. ?It also raises legitimate and disturbing questions as to whether accepting research funding from federal agencies is inherently unethical ornot agencies clearly have conflicts similar to those that are accepted and well understood for industry research sponsors,? Edwards and Roy continue in the study. ?Given the mistaken presumption of research neutrality by federal funding agencies, the dangers of institutional research misconduct to society may outweigh those of industry-sponsored research.? A study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report that they have engaged in ?questionable research practices,? including ?dropping data points on a gut feeling? and ?changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source,? whereas 72 percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. Virginia Tech researchers note that the National Science Foundation estimates that research misconduct creates over $110 million in annual costs. ?The second problem is that universities are biased towards federal funding, and will thus always be cheer-leading towards a dire view and treat people whodon share that view very badly,? Dr. Michaels continued. ?We?ve seen that repeatedly in climate science. There are enormous selective pressures to publish research that is dire and not publish research that is not.We creating biased canons of research because nobody will get a federal grant to study if global warming will have beneficial effects. The peer reviewers have a vested interest in making sure that the gravy train keeps rolling down the track.? In addition to outright fraud, these incentives lead to researchers not even bothering to write up negative results, as scientific journals tend to only publish the flashiest and most popular research. This biases the scientific canon and leads to duplication of research. Only seemingly groundbreaking research can lead to government grant money, scientific prizes, and potential tenure track jobs. ?The entire American model of getting published, getting funded, then getting promoted means that peoplearen publishing negative results,? Michaels told TheDCNF.They only publishing flashy research. Getting published in Science, Nature or Cell is a ticket to future funding, promotion and tenure. This is giving young scientists an incentive to go into flashy fields that might get them on television, not important ones. This has created systematic problems in science.? As a result of these problems, researchers have a documented tendency to find evidence of phenomenons they happen to believe in and to reject observations that are unpopular with federal funders. In a survey of two thousand research psychologists conducted in 2011, over half admitted they selectively reported experiments, which gave the result they were after.

"Posted by John Prager on 20 Sep 2016 That wacky, deplorable, Oompa Loompa stand-in Donald Trump is at it again! As part of his continuing African-American outreach? which has traditionally consisted of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (?no health care, no education, no anything? as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people.

"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a ?pressure cooker? device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person. Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers.Isn that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the ?bad guys.? Unfortunately, our leadership ? who ostensibly wants to protect us ? finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ? who famously ended ?stop-and-frisk? profiling in his city ? was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. ?There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,? de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. ?We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and ? agencies are at full alert?, he said.Isn ?an intentional act? terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. JamesO, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. NewYork Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word terrorismis defined. ?A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.? Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obviousassessment? The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that ?we need to do everything we can to support our first responders ? also to pray for the victims? and that ?we need to let this investigation unfold.? Trump was more direct. ?I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knowswhat going on,? he said. ?But boy we are living in atime better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough.It a terrible thingthat going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.? Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as ?soft targets.? Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

The revelations of the immunity granted left Republicans in utter shock. Then they got furious, but I guess they got out-maneuvered on this one. I told you these peoplearen stupid. There were a myriad of ways that Mills herself violated the law or at a minimum assisted Clinton in skirting it. In the New York Post earlier this month, Paul Sperry bluntly accused Mills of being the evil mastermind behind the Clinton email coverup: ? Mills ultimately made the determinations about which emails should be preserved before she and Clinton decided to delete the rest as personal? Mills was the one who ordered the server host to move the emails from the server to a laptop where she could screen them ? And Mills may have been a key player in the game of hide-and-seek.

Yet the Department ultimately failed to acquire enough evidence to pursue charges against her, as Director James Comey tried to explain two months ago: Every official in and out of the FBI involved in this whole investigation should be brought to account for this and should at the very least, lose their jobs, if not go to prison. According to the final House Benghazi Committee Report released three months ago, as reported by Politico, Mills also tainted ?the findings of an internal State Department review of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.?

"The reason 858 were given full citizenship is because our director of the Department of Homeland Security is a treasonous radical left-wing open borders advocate whodoesn give a damn aboutAmerica homeland security. Think aboutit Johnson is responsible for this negligence and enabling of any and all mistakesbig and small. He is the director of the DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY yethe a snake who continuously looks the other way while illegals from all over the globe cross our borders. Johnson famously said he felt that illegals were already American citizens: Thenation top immigration officer said that the ?11 million? undocumented aliens in the United States are ?not going away,? are ?in effect? citizens, and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant: THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TREASON! SKIP TO THE 25:00 MARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ILLEGALS: Well, he just made 858 illegals from hotbedterror countries American citizens! Hundreds of illegal immigrants from terrorist hotbeds who were supposed to have been deported were instead granted citizenship because Homeland Securitydidn have fingerprints on file to check their identity, thedepartment inspector general said in a stunning new report Monday. At least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said. But in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified. One of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields ? including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports. ?USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,? the inspector general said. The 858 cases involved people from so-called ?special interest? countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S.WHAT EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE: Investigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious. The problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications,wasn checking those paper-based files, so itdidn know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already. The inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.

" A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience ? and sends a dire warning to the American people. This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level: ?My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. ? Angell acknowledgesTrump long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought. ?I stick at a differentmoment lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, ?I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.? Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in mywar experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought atH Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twicewounded late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war. Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict ? or never learned them at all, as inTrump case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside oncethey served their purpose. Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle ? negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell. ?Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, ?How will I look?? This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only thenarcissist mirror for reassurance.? On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency: I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolutePresident last, a female leader of ourown, in the end, perhaps a unifying one. He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House: ?If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of badnews police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in themorning difficult events.

"The Clinton campaign has slammed Donald Trump as ?a fraud who believes the rulesdon apply to him? over reports that the GOP presidential candidate used money from his charitable foundation to settle two lawsuits filed against his for-profit businesses. The Washington Post reported today that Trump made two payments totaling $258,000 to settle suits ? one involving the Mar-a-Lago Club, which he owns, in Florida and another involving one of his golf clubs in New York.Clinton Camp ReactsClinton deputy communications director, Christina Reynolds, put out a statement after The Washington Post story was published, calling Trump a fraud. ?Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education,? she said. ?Trump?s version of charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal issues ... which experts say is a clear violation of laws governing charitable organizations,? Reynolds said. Lucien Capehart/Getty Images ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Lloyd Mayer, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News that if the allegations made by the Post are true, the payments violate federal law. John Roca/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images ?Federal tax law bars a private foundation like the Trump Foundation from using its assets to benefit its insiders or the businesses they own.That exactlywhat been alleged here. If true, the foundation and its managers, including Mr. Trump, violated tax laws,? Mayer told ABC News. A Lawsuit Behind the Allegations The lawsuit involving Mar-a-Lago, filed in 2007, revolved around a complaint by the town of Palm Beach over an oversize flagpole at the club. Publicly available court documents show that as a condition of a settlement, ?Mr. Trump will contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between the parties? in return for thetown waiving fines against Mar-a-Lago. Another section of the court documents specified, ?Mar-a-Lago shall contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between parties dealing with Iraq War veterans, American flag or the local VA hospital.? Richard Corkery/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images In a September 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the Post, Trump wrote, ?I have sent a check for $100,000 to Fisher House. Although the court documents show that under the settlement, Trump or Mar-a-Lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the Trump Foundation. Tax forms for the Trump Foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to Fisher House, an organization that helps pay for housing for veterans? relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. It was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a New York hospital and a police athletic league. Fisher House confirmed to ABC News that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on Sept. 11, 2007. It does not have a copy of the check available. Legal Questions The IRS has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. To qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that ?no part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,? according to an online IRS publication. Mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for byTrump foundation, hewouldn be the first person to violate tax law in this way. ?It?s not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. Usually if the IRS learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,? Mayer said. It can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but Mayer has ?never heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.? ?Here the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit toTrump business ? the dropping of lawsuits. That is clearly crossing the line.It not even close,? he said. The Foundation Takes in Money Other ThanTrump The Trump Foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago Trump himself. In 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. Of that total, Trump donated $35,000. Similarly, in 2008, Trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. In previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. Trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available. A few years after the Mar-a-Lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one ofTrump golf courses in New York, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation. The foundation is under investigation by the New York AttorneyGeneral Office over a payment made to a political group associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump supporter who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer. A person familiar with the probe tells ABC News that the New York AttorneyGeneral Office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the Post report. The Clintoncampaign Reynolds said in her statement, ?Once again, Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rulesdon apply to him.It past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.?

"On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen criticized a Barack Hussein Obama appointed federaljudge order reinstating DACA as offensive for even suggesting that ending the said program is racist. In addition, she went as far as to rightly declare DACA unconstitutional and unapologetically affirmed that her oath of office is to follow the U.S. Constitution. Nielsen appeared on the show Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace discussing various issues facing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but of course, a large majority of the interview concerned the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). DACA is an amnesty program for 800,000 illegal aliens announced by then President Barack Obama and developed by former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. DACA, which is a predecessor of an even wider program named DAPA was based on the same legal argument but instead covered over four million illegal aliens. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that DAPA was illegal and once President Trump was inaugurated, the federal government, under his order and that of Attorney General Sessions, dropped the remaining legal appeals and let the larger program lapse. Via Breitbart: DACA Amnesty Chain Migration Would Exceed Four Years of U.S. Births NEW YORK CITY, New York ? The Democrats? draft Dream Act amnesty would likely add as many chain-migration foreigners to the United States population as are added by the total number of Americans who are born in four years? time. As House and Senate Republicans, Democrats, the big business lobby, the cheap labor industry, and the open borders lobby have teamed up to push an amnesty for potentially millions of illegal aliens who are enrolled and eligible for the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the impact the move would have on Americans would be likely unprecedented. Under the current legal immigration system, immigrants who are given a pathway to U.S. citizenship are eventually allowed to bring extended family members, children, their parents, siblings, and extended family members to the country. This process, which makes up more than 70 percent of the current legal immigration, iswhat known as ?chain migration.? Research by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) reveals that under a DACA amnesty deal, between about 800,000 and 3.5 million illegal aliens could be eligible for legalization to permanently remain in the U.S. Of those, MPI notes that 1.5 million of the estimated 3.5 million would be allowed to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to Princeton University researchers Stacie Carr and Marta Tienda, newly naturalized Mexican immigrants in the U.S. bring an average of six foreign relatives with them. Therefore, should all 1.5 million amnestied illegal aliens bring six relatives each to the U.S., that would constitute a total chain migration of nine million new foreign nationals entering the U.S. Chain Migration of Potentially 19M Foreign Nationals Would Follow Amnesty for Illegal Aliens -? Amnesty for illegal aliens would lead to unprecedented chain migration of upwards of 10 million foreign nationals, under current law. If the number of amnestied illegal aliens who gained a pathway to citizenship under an amnesty plan were to rise to the full 3.3 million, and if each brought in three to six foreign family members, the chain migration flow could range from 9.9 million to 19.8 million foreign nationals coming to the U.S. This chain migration flow triggered by a DACA amnesty ? where an end to chain migration is not coupled with the plan ? would be more than double the number of babies born in the U.S. every single year, which stands at about four million a year. Should a DACA amnesty trigger a chain migration flow of 19 million foreign nationals, it would be more than quadruple the number of American births every year. The chain migration of a DACA amnesty would potentially outpace the populations of American cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. Such a chain migration would boom the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S. to a historic high. Currently, the foreign-born population is already at historic levels, reaching 44 million this year with no end in sight as legal immigration reductions to give relief toAmerica working and middle-classes are stalled in Congress. Trump has previously stated that an amnesty deal for DACA illegal aliens would have to include an end on chain migration in order to stop surges of legal immigration to the U.S., though it remains unclear how many Republicans would be willing to break from their big business donors to help pass a law to end chain migration. Most recently, a group of Senators released legislation known as the SECURE Act that would end chain migration ? thus reducing legal immigration to 500,000 admissions a year to give relief to Americans ? but couples the pro-American immigration reform with an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens. Nearly 120,000 foreign nationals have been allowed to enter the U.S. since 2005, despite coming from countries designated as state-sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, Syria and Sudan, Breitbart News reported. Chain Migration Imported 120K Foreign Nationals from Terrorist-Funding Countries Since 2005 -? Nearly 120,000 foreign nationals have been allowed to enter the US since 2005 despite coming from state-sponsors of terrorism. In total, about 9.3 million foreign nationals have entered the U.S. since 2005 because of chain migration, making it the largest driver of legal immigration to the country. As Breitbart News reported, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration ? with every two new immigrants bringing seven foreign relatives with them. What we all need to keep in mind is the fact that almost a million illegals who would be covered under DACA would account for another 23 new immigrants each, because of the idiotic laws concerning chain migration. That would mean that DACA would add another 19 million people to the US. That would most certainly mean another 18 million Democrat voters in the future. Many of which are located in the Republican stronghold of Texas. If the GOP ever does lose the state of Texas there will never be another Republican President again. And if you believe Texasisn in play? Let me remind you that California went to Nixon, even in 1960, and then to Reagan twice and George H.W. Bush in 1988.

"2016 Clinton gets underTrump skin The Republican nominee loses his cool as a composed Clinton hits him on his business record, the Iraq war, and his secret Islamic State plan. HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ? A composed Hillary Clinton got under DonaldTrump skin during their high-stakes showdown on Monday night, with the Republican nominee persistently interrupting Clinton as she needled him on his business record, the size of his fortune and his relationship with the truth. For 90 minutes at Hofstra University, Clinton and Trump clashed on style and specifics, disagreeing about foreign policy, economic plans and their readiness for the Oval Office. But for most of the evening, it was Clinton who was driving the agenda. She rattled off crisp prepared lines and repeatedly lured Trump into less politically favorable terrain, including a long discussion of why he was refusing to release his taxes. Story Continued Below ?First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is,? Clinton suggested. ?Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.? The much-hyped debate opened up with momentary niceties ? Trump called her ?Secretary Clinton, yes, is that okay?? ? and a friendly handshake that briefly masked the tension of aknife edge contest that is well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. And in an unprecedented moment for presidential politics, the Democratic nominee midway through the debate accused the Republican nominee of racism. ?He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,? Clinton said, during an exchange onTrump years-long questioning of the American citizenship of President Barack Obama. Trump soon fired back with one of theevening most memorable lines. ?When you try to act holier than thou it reallydoesn work.? The exchange was emblematic of a debate not deep on substantive policy differences but full of attacks, with both candidates landing blows that will resonate with their established bases of support. ?I have a feeling that by the end of this evening I am going to be blamed for everything,? Clinton said with a smile. ?Why not?? Trump retorted. ?Just join the debate by saying more crazy things,? Clinton shot back. Clinton seemed to gain steam as the debate went on, hitting Trump in the closing minutes for his past attacks objectifyingwomen appearances. The former secretary of state often appeared relaxed as Trump scowled and tried to jump in during her answers. Clinton had prepared for weeks for the face-off with Trump, complete with briefing books and mock debates. Trump has eschewed such traditional preparation and, while he landed some of theevening most memorable lines, his performance was far more uneven. In one of thedebate tenser moments, Trump swiped atClinton recent time off the campaign trail when she came down with pneumonia and holed up for debate preparation. ?You decided to stay home and that's okay,? Trump said with more than a hint of sarcasm. ?I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,? Clinton said. ?And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.? Under sustained attack, Trump did not have a meltdown, even as he misrepresented key elements on his record, including citing opposition to the war in Iraq despite the public record, and insisting that Clinton began raising questions ofObama citizenship. Asked about his judgement toward the end of the debate, Trump declared, ?I think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not.? It was theevening most talked-about line both on Facebook and Twitter. Throughout, Trump stuck to knocking Clinton as a predictable, talking-point driven, lifelong politician. ?Typical politician. All talk. No action. Sounds good.Doesn work. Never gonna happen,? Trump said in a staccato summation of his debate plan. In the closing minutes, Trump summarized his appeal again. ?Hillary has experience,? Trump said. ?Butit bad experience.? The two candidates sniped about nearly everything from climate change to the economy to ISIS to trade to their records. One of the longest exchanges came not on tax policy ? butTrump refusal to release his taxes, breaking decades of precedent for presidential candidates. Trump got a rise out of the audience ? against thedebate ground rules of silence from the crowd -- by pledging to release his tax returns if Clinton releases all of the emails her staff deleted from the private email server she used as secretary of state. ?I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,? Trump declared. ?So it's negotiable?? moderator Lester Holt asked, with Trump shooting back, ?It's not negotiable, no.? Clinton tried to turn the attack on her private email use back on Trump, who had previously said hewouldn release his tax returns until a routine audit is completed. ?I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns,? Clinton said. Clinton tried to direct viewers to her website for real-time fact-checking of Trump. Trump directed viewers there, too, at one point. ?She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MaCarthur would like that too much,? Trump said of the 20thcentury general. ?At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,? Clinton said. ?No, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,? Trump said about a group that has only existed for a few years. Trumpdidn just tangle with Clinton ? but with Holt. When Trump said, despite the public record, that he was opposed to the war in Iraq, Holt interjected ?The record shows otherwise,? Holt said. ?The record shows thatI right,? Trump said. Back and forth, they went. When Clinton finally got her turn, she exclaimed, ?Whew! Okay?? Clinton more than once made accusations that caused Trump to blurt out interruptions, referring to him only by his first name. ?Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,? she said. ?That?s called business,? Trump jumped in. View The 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night from the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday. ?Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real,? she said at another point. ?I did not say that,? Trump countered. ?I did not say that.? And when she hit him for his rhetoric about failing black communities, he sighed audibly. More than anything, Clinton sought to make the evening a referendum onTrump truthfulness, even as polls show the public have many questions about her own trustworthiness. ?Donald, I know you live in your own reality,? she said to Trump during an exchange about trade, ?but that is not the facts.? They went back and forth several times, but Clinton ultimately got the last word.",0.046538025,0.004540295,0.007945516,0.007945516,0.070374574,0.311010216,0.002270148,2,-1,1

The issue ofTrump support for the birther movement was raised late in Mondaynight presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest.

"BREAKING NEWS: Arrest Made In DEATH Of Charlotte Protester ? DETAILS [VIDEO] During the violent protests in Charlotte, NC, a protester shot into the crowd there. He wound up shooting Justin Carr in the head. At first the media reported he had died? Justin did not die until last night ? he was on life support. This morning, the police apprehended the man they think killed him? Rayquan Borum. There are those saying the police killed Justin with rubber bullets. Idon believe that at all. Surveillance video shows Borum shooting the gun that killed Justin. Lay blame where blame is due. The shooting happened the second night of the protests in Charlotte. It was an awful, bloody scene. Idon know why anyone would just fire into the crowd like that. It makes no sense. Someone was bound to be hit and die. Maybe the guy justdidn care. A white man was also kicked and beaten brutally in a garage by the protesters there. So much violence over a justified shooting by a black police officer.It as if factsdon matter? they just want revolution in the streets. From The Federalist Papers Project: The several nights of chaos in Charlotte, North Carolina led to the death of a man who was present at the protests; his name was Justin Carr. He was shot on Wednesday night and and died Thursday morning. Amid the chaos, it was difficult to tell exactly what happened. All we have known up until this point was that one of the protesters fired on Carr and that his injuries led to his death. However, there are new developments out of Charlotte. Fox News has more: Rayquan Borum, 21, was charged Friday morning in shooting death of Justin Carr, who died a day after being shot during protests in Trade Street, Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Putney said surveillance footage supplied by buildings in the area helped identify the suspect. The shooting occurred Wednesday night, and Charlotte police initially said the man had died, although he survived on life support until Thursday. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts about who shot him, with some insisting they saw police gun him down with rubber bullets, while others said he was killed by a fellow protester. Who will protest for Justin Carr? Certainly not Black Lives Matter. To them, he is a war casualty.They just step over his body and riot on. There will be no marches or demands for justice for Justin. These people use others and then discard their dead bodies as they go.It the communist, radical way. They are now trying to lay the blame for JustinCarr death on the police. Idon believe it andwon until I see video proving it. It is far more likely it is the guy that has been arrested. My only question is did someone pay him to shoot things up?

"On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. So how exactly does a veto override work? The rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it."" In other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first. Both the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which eachsenator name is called by the clerk. Though the Senate received PresidentObama veto message on Friday,they not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor. Then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?"" While some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass. Assuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue. If the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.",0.022556391,0,0.003759398,0.007518797,0.026315789,0.304511278,0.003759398,2,-1,1
"Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016We all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably ?read mylips new taxes,? a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. Hedidn promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.Let imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. Destroydoesn?t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty ?yeeeeehaw,? the reality is thathe talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America.He talking about profiling Muslims.He talking about DonaldTrump version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an American citizen with the right to due process. Just becausehe a suspect in a bombingdoesn meanhe guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked killand not on the most wanted list.There nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that underTrump dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you thinkI being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. Itisn about the narrative. Itisn about prevention or education.It about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that whathe promising is nothing but another ?read my lips.? Terrorismisn something you can simply destroyjust because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but itisn going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of DonaldTrump campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

"Donald Trump makes a visit to Stamey's Barbecue on Sept. 20 in Greensboro, North Carolina. | AP Photo Trump forces lagged Clinton in August money race But Trump finally showed signs of building a more conventional political infrastructure. Even as Donald Trump and his allies ramped up their fundraising and political infrastructure in August, their combined monthly fundraising haul lagged $42 million behind that of HillaryClinton forces, according to a POLITICO analysis of reports filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. The Trump campaign, two supportive super PACs and the Republican National Committee pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of August, when his campaign shook up its leadership in an attempt to reboot after a chaotic nominating convention in July. Story Continued Below By contrast, the Clinton campaign, an allied super PAC and the Democratic National Committee, leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in August, as her campaign rode a strong bounce from its tightly choreographed, star-studded convention.Trump forces entered September with almost $96 million in the bank, whileClinton started the month with $121.4 million, according toPolitico analysis. The analysis does not include fundraising tallies for the joint fundraising committees the rival candidates created with their respective parties, nor does it include the fundraising hauls from some supportive super PACs. All of those committees disclose their finances on a quarterly basis, meaning theywon be required to file detailed financial reports until Oct. 15. But the analysis provides revealing hints about the contrasting strategies employed by the presidential candidates and their allies. The joint fundraising committee that Trump created with the RNC appears to be sitting on a significant sum of cash ? perhaps as much as $47 million at the end of last month ? while distributing only $12 million to the RNC itself and $20 million toTrump campaign. That transfer to Trump accounted for nearly half his August total ? the first timehe received such a large portion of his cash that way. Clinton, on the other hand, received $31.4 million from her own joint fundraising vehicle, and the Democratic National Committee received $12 million. An additional $12 million appear to have gone to state parties but been rerouted to the DNC, repeating a pattern from previous months. (The DNC also transferred out some $14 million to various state parties in August.)Trump campaign, which had largely eschewed spending on the trappings of political tactics, showed early signs of implementing a more conventional operation under its new leadership. It spent serious money ? $5.3 million ? on paid media in August, most of which went through Rick Reed Media, though $718,000 went through Jamestown Associates, the firm of his then-new senior communications adviser Jason Miller. That was dwarfed by the $32.7 million that Clinton paid her media buyer, GMMB, in August. Trump spent almost $1 million on field consultants, up from $432,000 in July. And hiscampaign staff grew to 140 people, with a total payroll of $643,000, up from $392,000 for 84 people in July. But that still trailedClinton 789-person, $3.3 million payroll. Trump more than doubled his spending on field consulting in August to $973,000. The campaign also paid for polling, something it had been reluctant to do, directing $128,500 to the firm of Kellyanne Conway, who took over as campaign manager late in the month. And it spent $250,000 on data services provided by Cambridge Analytica, a firm owned largely by the influential Mercer family , which played a pivotal role inTrump campaign shakeup and is spearheading one of the super PACs backing the campaign. Still, the campaign continued devoting serious cash to bankroll the former reality TVstar traveling show: $2 million went for rally-related expenses including facility rentals, audio-visual services, and event staging and consulting. Then, of course, there was the spending on Trump branding, which included $420,00 on hats and $1.7 million on T-shirts and other merchandise. And the campaign spent $547,000 on services provided byTrump own companies, including $170,000 for rent at Trump Tower and $319,000 on TAG Air Inc. By contrast, Trump spent only $80,000 on strategy consulting, with the firm of fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski receiving $20,000 of that. And thecampaign largest expense continued to be online advertising and fundraising payments to the Austin-based digital firm ofTrump digital director Brad Parscale, who is running thecampaign online fundraising and advertising efforts, despite having no prior political experience. His firm reaped $11.1 million in August ? up nearly $3 million from July and good for a third of all thecampaign spending. Although the online fundraising effort overseen by Parscale helped produce an impressive small-dollar haul in which 65 percent of thecampaign contributions came in amounts of less than $200, the payments to Giles-Parscale suggest the campaign has spent heavily on list rentals, email solicitations and online advertising to round up those small contributions. The percentage of cash that Clinton raised from small donors was half ofTrump. About 31 percent of her cash came in checks of less than $200, which actually marked a slight improvement over her average across the cycle. Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine focused in August on big-dollar fundraisers in exclusive summer destinations. Likewise, the main super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, drew more than half of its $23.4 million August haul from its top five donors: Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner ($3 million each), billionaire financier George Soros ($2.5 million), investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs? Emerson Collective (both with $2 million). Trump received some good news this week about the fundraising of his own high-dollar super PACs. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had been sitting out the cycle so far, and his wife, Miriam, reportedly committed $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC effort, but the group to which he has pledged the cashhasn launched the effort and itwon disclose its finances until next month. The other super PACs supporting Trump have continued to lag in fundraising. Make America Number 1, the pro-Trump super PAC run by the Mercer family, received $1 million from Cherna Moskowitz, a Miami philanthropist, and $50,000 from Erik Prince, who founded the defense contractor Blackwater. But itdidn receive any other big checks anddidn get a dime in August from the Mercer family, which had donated $2 million to the PAC in July. Another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America PAC, appears to have thecampaign blessing after Eric Trump, thecandidate son, attended one of its events . But it raised only $3.6 million in August, including $250,000 from RHS Investments, a Texas company that appears to be tied to banking executive Robert H. Seale, and $200,000 from Martin Harmon of Rocklin, Calif. The Committee to RestoreAmerica Greatness and Rebuilding America Now ? other pro-Trump super PACs ?won disclose their financials until next month because they report on a quarterly cycle.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched. The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August.

"""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Hillary Clinton said of Donald Trump. | Getty Clinton on Trump's birther claim: A 'racist lie' Donald Trump defended his long-running questioning of President Barack Obama's birthplace during Monday's presidential debate, while Hillary Clinton called it a ""racist lie"" that ""can't be dismissed that easily."" During a segment on racial healing, Trump repeatedly praised himself for pushing the president to produce his long-form birth certificate in 2011. The document proved Obama was born in Hawaii. Story Continued Below ""I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate,"" Trump said. As moderator Lester Holt tried to ask Trump what he would say to Americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, Trump cut off the question and said: ""I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it."" The Republican nominee also insisted that it was Clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. He further pointed to Clinton's tough Democratic primary clash with Obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect. Clinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of Trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to African Americans. ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one,"" Clinton said. ""Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him."" Trump retorted by saying his company had settled ""the suit with zero -- no admission of guilt.""

"During her election campaign, mayor Virginia Raggi had expressed doubts whether Rome should host the sporting event | Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images Rome withdraws 2024 Olympics bid Paris, Budapest and Los Angeles remain in the race to host the Games.Rome new mayor Virginia Raggi on Wednesday pulled the plug on the Italiancapital ambition to become a candidate to host the 2024 Olympics. Raggi, a member of the anti-establishment 5Star Movement and the first female mayor of Rome, argued that hosting the Olympics would leave Rome more indebted than it is now and that the infrastructure built for the Olympics would turn into ?cathedrals in the desert? after the event. ?It is irresponsible to approve this candidacy,? Raggi told reporters in Rome Wednesday. With Rome out of the contest, three cities, Paris, Los Angeles and Budapest, remain in the race to host the Olympic Games eight years from now. During her election campaign, Raggi had expressed doubts whether Rome, a deeply indebted city which has been struggling with waste management problem for months, should host the sporting event. She had stopped short of saying she would withdrawRome candidacy if elected mayor, raising hopes among supporters of the project, including Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, that she could change her mind The International Olympic Committee will choose the city that will host the 2024 Games in ayear time.

"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ? Score round 1 for Hillary Clinton.That according to The POLITICO Caucus ? a panel of swing-state activists, strategists and operatives who watched the first debate here Monday night. The insiders? bipartisan verdict: Clinton dispatched Donald Trump in their first of three nationally televised meetings. Story Continued Below Overall, roughly 80 percent of insiders ? with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans responding to the post-debate survey ? said Clinton did the better job at the debate, including 99 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans. Only 21 percent ? 1 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans ? picked Trump as the winner. Democrats said Clinton was prepared and succeeded in provoking Trump ? who began the debate speaking so quietly the audio engineers struggled to raise his volume to a comparable level in the debate hall but quickly became more animated in the face ofClinton attacks. ?No contest,? said an Iowa Democrat ? who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ?Trump held it together for 16 minutes and fell apart.? ?Trump melted down,? added a Florida Democrat. ?This is bad for him. [It] confirms all the worries of swing voters.? Some Democrats predicted the debate would swing the momentum, which appeared to be with Trump, with public polls showing a tightening race. ?Donald Trump exposed himself to be a clown,? added a New Hampshire Democrat, who also predicted ?the polls will show dramatic movement in next 24 hours.? But a Florida Democrat countered thatClinton performance was unlikely to change fundamentally the trajectory of the race. ?It is becoming a base turnout election, and she did a great job tonight of making the stakes in this election very clear,? the Democrat said. Among Republicans, the tally was closer ? but that speaks to a divided party as much as actual ambivalence about which candidate performed better on Monday night. ?Trump was an embarrassment,? an Iowa Republican said. ?I'd hate to be the guy in the spin room lying about how Trump won the debate.? ?It wasn't close,? a Virginia Republican added. ?Sure, our tribal politics will force it to seem somewhat close, but even the most committed of Trump supporters know, deep down, that did not go well.? But there was a significant share of Republicans who thought Trump won ? most of whom saidTrump outside appeal could be the most memorable aspect of the debate. ?Hillary Clinton sounded like every politician has sounded for the last half century. Donald Trump did not,? said an Ohio Republican. ?This year that may just be enough.? ?Neither candidate earned a single undecided vote,? a Nevada Republican added. ?Clinton supporters will think she won. Trump supporters will think he won. Trump gets the nod because he did not completely implode.? Here are two other takeaways from the first debate: Clinton met expectations on Monday night, while insiders are mixed on Trump. The vast majority of all insiders, 88 percent, said Clinton met expectations going into Monday night. That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans: One Florida Republican called Clinton ?calm in the face of an insane person.? Insiders were more mixed on Trump, on the other hand. Overall, 55 percent of insiders said Trump met expectations: 40 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans. ?There were no expectations,? said an Iowa Republican. ?He got off to a great start, appeared reserved, but then he took the bait. The sneers and reactions when Clinton was speaking undercut his first impression.? But for some Republicans, meeting expectationswasn good enough. The expectations ?were low,? said one Pennsylvania Republican. ?He needed to exceed [them], and he didn't.? And a Virginia Republican said Trump did little to appeal to a key group of Republican-leaning voters whom Trump is repelling this year: white-collar whites. ?He needs college whites, and he didn't connect,? the Republican said. Republicans are divided on the political impact of the debate. GOP insidersaren sure whether Trump is better or worse off after the Monday night debate. Asked whetherTrump performance makes it more likely he wins the race, just 31 percent said yes ? comparable to the 33 percent who said itdoesn. A slim plurality, 36 percent, said the debatewouldn have a significant impact onTrump chances. The debate was ?not fatal, but very definitely a missed opportunity,? said one New Hampshire Republican. ""Neither of them made a persuasive case that they were more fit than the other to be president. At this point that advantages Trump,"" said an Ohio Republican. ?Put plainly: he failed the presidential test,? a Virginia Republican added. ?And hiding out on Fox News isn't going to fix it for him.? But despite ? or perhaps because of ?Trump unconventional debate style, some insiders said his message could resonate more than the pundits think in the immediate wake of the debate. ?He spoke in a language that normal Americans understand,? a Virginia Republican said. ?America is looking for something different,? a Colorado Republican added. ?He is very different.? View The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump The First Presidential Debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, on September 26th, 2016 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY. And some Republicans cautioned against reading too much into the first match-up. ?There are two more debates to watch,? said a Virginia Republican. ?Trump has more he can adjust, [while] Hillary is a fixed quantity as a virtual 30-year political incumbent. Trump will be more aggressive in the next two debates.? Among Democrats, it was more decisive: 60 percent said the debate made it less likely Trump becomes president, compared to 15 percent who said it makes it more likely and 25 percent who said itwouldn have an impact. ?Trump wasn't presidential,? a Colorado Democrat said. ?He needed to show restraint, and he failed. Tonight was his opportunity to show the country how he would govern, and he missed the opportunity.?

"I thinkwhat most likely is that the audience just thought the candidate was being funny. I mean,isn it a joke to say that anyone in the Clinton family is honest? Even if itweren a joke, the congressional candidate on the Democratic ticket had to have known that his comment would have elicited laughter from the audience. He made his comments during a debate with incumbent representative David Jolly. Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is vying for Rep.Jolly spot in thestate 13th congressional district. The moderator had asked Crist if he was planning on voting for hisparty nominee.Here how he answered: ?I am proud of Hillary Clinton.

"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. Interested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth. New Jersey State Police A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings. Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey. One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend. Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials. New Jersey State Police The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there. ""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home."" Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents. Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan. New Jersey State Police In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted. Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks. Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney. A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami. New Jersey State Police ABC News' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report. [Editor's Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami's father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]",0.034836066,0.00204918,0.006147541,0.008196721,0.057377049,0.254098361,0,2,-1,1
" Republican nominee DonaldTrump Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in Americadidn exist until President Obama. ?Idon think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this ? Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens,that a big change, and I thinkthat the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.? This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance ? blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy. Supporting hercandidate constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that ?ifyou black and youhaven been successful in the last 50 years,it your own fault.You had every opportunity, it was given to you.You had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kidsdidn have. You had all the advantages anddidn take advantage of it.It not our fault, certainly.? To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that ?the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time? and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans ?were raised.? In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface. She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied ?Idon care,it the truth.? The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.

"In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. | AP Photo When does early voting start in every state? Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday. Election Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president. Voting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.) Story Continued Below In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case. Typically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.Here when early voting begins in each state. (Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.)

"Charlotte Police REVEAL What They Said To Black Man Just Moments Before Shooting? There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85. But allwe being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter. What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. ?It?s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that thestory a little bit different as to howit been portrayed so far, especially through social media,? he said. As an officer,you hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense? Ohthat right, itdoesn.

"There?s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police. Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks? star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: ?I?m not going to answer any questions today, andit no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increasepeople awareness and put a spotlight on it andthey being ignored. Whetherthey taking a knee or whetherthey locking arms, you know,they trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling. The reasonwe locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know,it not right for people to get killed in the street.? Sherman then explains howhe been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says, ?that?s an unfortunate time to be living.? Especially when people are being killed for no reason. He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: ?When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can sayhe not being patriotic.He not honoring the flag.I doing none of those things.I saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something.?

"While the biggest attraction during the presidential debate tonight will be the two candidates on stage, at least some attention will likely be paid to those in the audience. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Here's a look at who the candidates invited to sit in the audience at tonight's debate. Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton's campaign this morning released a partial list of guests invited by the Democratic presidential nominee to the debate at Hofstra University in New York. The four women on the list are all supporters who have developed a special relationship with Clinton over the years. They include a 9/11 survivor; a single mom and domestic abuse survivor; and a woman who became a pen pal to Clinton when she was the first lady. The list also includes Anastasia Somoza -- a woman with cerebral palsy who was recently featured in a campaign attack ad about Donald Trump's mocking of a disabled reporter. Most notably, the Clinton campaign has also given Dallas Mavericks owner and Trump antagonist Mark Cuban a front-row ticket for the show. Chelsea Clinton is also expected to attend, according to a spokeswoman for the former first daughter. And, the Clinton camp said this morning it is hosting 1,200 debate-watch parties across all 50 states tonight. Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine will attend a watch party in Orlando, Florida, organized by the Human Rights Campaign. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, will also attend that event, an aide said. Donald Trump This morning, reports emerged that the Republican nominee invited Mark Geist, one of the survivors of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to attend the debate. Geist has been vocal in his support of Trump's candidacy; he spoke on the first night of the Republican National Convention alongside fellow security contractor John Tiegen about the attack in Benghazi. Trump also over the weekend fired off a tweet about a possible guest to the debate. After Mark Cuban posted about his plans to attend the event in support of Clinton, Trump tweeted Saturday: ?If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!?

"As the candidates jabbed one another over and over again, Lester Holt kept trying to jump in. | Getty Lester Holt stays out of the way Under pressure, he lets the candidates have their say, but leaves some important topics uncovered. Lester Holt was on an island on Monday night. And for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shoot their missiles at one another. It made for some memorable exchanges between Trump and Clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. For some debate watchers,that what they want their moderators to do: say ""go"" and let them run. But it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. Story Continued Below There was no probing ofTrump wall with Mexico, and vow to get the Mexicans to pay for it, or the Republicannominee ban on Muslims entering the country. And he barely prodded Clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences. The Clinton Foundation?Wasn discussed; neither was the Benghazi attack. Few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as Holt did, withClinton allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker andTrump backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say. Before the network broadcasts began, Holt seemed to reveal his choice, telling the audience he wanted to facilitatethe conversation between ?just the two of them.? Holt is often seen as understated. His arrival on the national stage was under the radar, as he quietly assumed the NBC anchor chair while Brian Williams? career was careening to a halt, removed as anchor of ?Nightly News? over allegations he exaggerated his experience covering the Iraq war. But during the debate, that understated approach sometimes led to the candidates, especially Trump, rolling over his questions, with Holt at one point admitting that they were far behind schedule. It started early, during the first segment about the economy. Holt asked Trump how he specifically will help put money back in the pocket of Americans. Trump offered few specifics, veering into criticism ofClinton decades of public service without improving trade agreements. Holt tried to interrupt but Trump kept rolling. He managed, a few seconds later, to follow up, pressing for specifics. But the end of the first segment would lead some critics on Twitter to ask ?Where?s Lester?"" ""Apparently Lester Holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line,? joked National Review writer Jim Geraghty in a tweet. As Clinton and Trump sparred over debate and taxes, jabbing one another over and over again, Holt kept trying to jump in. ""Let me get you to pause right there,? he said as Trump was claiming Clinton was going to ?approve one of the biggest tax increases."" ""Lester, that can't be left to stand,? Clinton shot back, one of several times she asked Holt to ?turn back the clock? or step in as Trump steamrolled through questions. When Trump continuously interrupted Clinton during her answers, Holt would at most offer a pleading,""This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."" ButHolt understatementdidn mean he was completely walked over. At different points, Holt pushed back against both candidates. ""Last week you said we have to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe police are implicitly biassed against black people?? Holt asked Clinton. And as the debate went on, he became more engaged and pushed back harder against Trump, on his birtherism, Iraq War support and his taxes. When Trump tried to assert again, falsely, that he was always against the Iraq war, Holt was sure to not step into the same problems his colleague Matt Lauer, who letTrump claim hedidn support the Iraq war slide. Initially, Holt did not interrupt when Trump barked Wrongas Clinton said he supported the war. But a few moments later, he came back. ?The record shows otherwise,? Holt said, later referring toTrump 2002 interview with Howard Stern, which Trump himself then later said that in the interview with Stern said he said ""who knows."" The reaction from the media and pundits was mixed, though mostly positive. ?[Holt] provided some realtime fact checking but let Trump go off on tangents and repeat too many proven lies,? said Washingotn Post Media columnist Margaret Sullivan, giving holt a ?B-minus? grade. ""[Holt] didn't make himself the story, and was dignified, if medium-weak and sometimes absent."" Former CNN Washington Bureau Chief Frank Sesno offered: ""I think Holt has done an excellent job. Has been firm and fair, called Trump on statements more than Hillary but spent most of his efforts steering the conversation / debate to the two candidates.? Not everyone was not as happy with how Holt treated Trump. ""Has the moderator challenged Clinton on anything?? tweeted the tax-cut activist Grover Norquist. ?Lester Holt interrupted Mr. Trump more, he followed up with Mr. Trump more, he was much hard on Mr. Trump,? complained Trump senior advisor Boris Epshteyn. ""Lester Holt, to a degree, succumbed to the pressure form the left wing media and the Democrats after Matt Lauer moderated the forum."" Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk show host,didn seem to agree. ""Conservatives should agree @LesterHoltNBC did a very fine job moderating.

"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date? December, 2017 November, 2017 October, 2017 September, 2017 August, 2017 July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 More of Hillary Clinton's emails could be released before Election Day. | Getty Deal nears to speed release of Hillary Clinton emails A potential compromise is in the works that could result in more Hillary Clinton emails recovered by the FBI being made public before the election. Last week, a judge ordered the processing under the Freedom of Information Act of a relatively meager 1,050 pages of the FBI-found emails before Election Day. Government lawyers say the FBI turned over about 5,600 work-related Clinton emails to the State Department beginning in July, although some are duplicates of records already processed and released. During a court hearing in a separate FOIA lawsuit Monday, another judge pushed for a deal that could accelerate the release of those messages, perhaps three-fold, in advance of the Nov. 8 vote, in which Clinton is hoping to win the White House in a showdown with Donald Trump. Acting on a case brought by Vice News journalist Jason Leopold, U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered the two sides to try to work out a compromise to devote more of State's resources to processing Clinton's emails in the coming weeks, rather than other records Leopold has requested. Contreras ordered both sides to report by Wednesday whether a deal can be reached to speed review of the FBI-found Clinton emails. Ryan James, an attorney for Leopold, said that if it was ""not possible"" for State to allocate more resources to the Clinton email disclosure, Leopold would be ""willing to sacrifice"" pages he's due of other Clinton-related records in order to get more of the emails released. About 2,200 pages of assorted records are scheduled for processing in the coming month in Leopold's case. Speaking of the FBI-recovered emails, James said: ""We believe those records are more important."" Initially, Justice Department attorney Robert Prince did not sound terribly receptive to the proposal. He that said the email-focused part of Leopold's suit against the State Department doesn't even encompass the full set of FBI-provided emails, and that Leopold previously agreed to limit the Clinton email-related portion of his suit to the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over on paper in December 2014. The Vice News reporter initially submitted a very broad request for almost every Clinton-related record at State, but later agreed to narrow it to Clinton emails, as well as other records on specific topics. But Contreras said it would be odd to penalize Leopold for not having foreseen that some emails would be obtained by the FBI. ""No one knew these documents existed ... and these documents should have been in the 55,000,"" the judge said. Prince said the fact they weren't in the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over did not necessarily reflect any impropriety. And there might be valid reasons these emails weren't in that set, he argued. ""Just because Secretary Clinton deleted an email does not mean anything untoward happened here,"" Prince said, noting that federal employees are generally not obliged to save all emails, even those that are-work related. ""I'm not suggesting that,"" replied Contreras, who issued the original order that led to State's public release of the 54,000 Clinton emails ? a process that was completed in February. However, the judge said he believed both sides could work out a compromise that would reallocate some of State's resources to the Clinton email project. ""It seems to me that if the two of you actually spoke to each other, you could reach some agreement,"" Contreras said. ""I'm not going to order that everything be produced by Election Day. That's just impossible."" The judge called a recess in the hearing and ordered the two sides to confer about a possible arrangement. After a half-hour break, Prince returned to the courtroom shortly before noon to say that Justice Department and State Department lawyers handling the case were open to a reallocation of resources but needed approval from Eric Stein, a State Department FOIA official who could not immediately be reached. The potential deal was discussed again Monday afternoon during a separate hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss, who is overseeing a suit Leopold filed against the FBI for certain records related to the Clinton email probe. James, who appeared by phone at both hearings, referred at one point to a ""tentative agreement"" that he said would result in processing an additional 2,200 pages of Clinton emails for release by Oct. 31. That would be on top of the earlier order ? issued in a case brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch ? that State process 350 pages every two weeks, leading to releases on Oct. 7, Oct. 21 and Nov. 4. But Justice Department lawyer Jennie Kneedler said James was overstating how close the parties were to a deal. ""It's under consideration. I wouldn't describe it as a tentative agreement,"" Kneedler said. She also suggested, as Prince did at the earlier hearing, that with various records at various stages of the review process, suspending work on one set of records and moving people to another might not yield as many records as quickly as James was suggesting. ""As I'm sure your honor could appreciate, it's not a simple transfer for resources,"" Kneedler told Moss. Kneedler was unable to tell Moss where the FBI got the additional Clinton emails, although the Justice Department lawyer suggested some may have come from an email account longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had on Clinton's server. The hearing before Moss proceeded on the assumption that if State determines the Clinton emails are entirely personal, they won't even be processed for release. However, since the records were obtained by the FBI in a criminal investigation, they could be FBI records even if not considered part of State's official files. That could result in partial release of some messages that are not work-related, even if State isn't processing them right now. During the morning hearing, Leopold's lawyer mounted a last-minute bid to try to get any additional emails that may be released sent ""directly"" to the Vice News reporter through his attorney, apparently in lieu of them being made public on State's website. The request echoed a debate among transparency advocates about whether records the government discloses should be immediately released to all via the Internet, or sent to the requester some time before everyone else gets them. Contreras turned down James' request that Leopold have first dibs on any additional emails. ""I'm happy with them posting it on the website. FOIA is about informing the public what their government is up to and that means everybody,"" the judge said. The issue did not arise before Moss, with all parties saying they expected any additional Clinton emails to be posted on State's website.

"I want this administrator to contact me.It not that hard ? that is, unlessyou truly the coward I sense that you are! As Written By Allen B. West: We know about the issues of free speech on our colleges and universities. It appears there are those who define free speech as the speech they deem acceptable. If you attempt to speak on issues to which the liberal progressive socialist left does not consent, you should be censored. Or at a minimum, the little cupcakes ask for a ?safe space? where theydon have to hear opposing views ? and here we were under the impression that institutions of higher learning were supposed to be places to encourage the free exchange of ideas. Many timeswe seen on the news and elsewhere stories of conservative speakers being denied the right to speak on college campuses.I watched this and just shaken my head. And then I would ask myself, when will it happen to me? Well, it has andI not happy about it at all. Earlier today, I did a radio interview with former Boston Red Sox baseball superstar pitcher Curt Schilling, and he informed me of somethingthat happening at St. Louis University of which Iwasn aware.I to speak on the campus of St. Louis University next week, September 29th, for the YoungAmerica Foundation (YAF), a student conservative organization. It appearsthere some administrator at St. Louis University who is attempting to limit the free speech of the YAF chapter on campus. I contacted my speakers bureau, Worldwide Speakers Group, who confirmed through YAF Headquarters in Virginia that a very disconcerting and disrespectful action was being taken. As posted at the YAF website, This week an administrator at Saint Louis University (SLU) informed students organizing a YAF-sponosred lecture by Lt. Col. Allen West they were not allowed to use the words ?radical Islam? on any advertisements for the event. The administrator also claimed West, who is a veteran of both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, does not ?have experience with radical Islam.? These comments were made after students submitted event flyers for approval and campus officials rejected their design due to the inclusion of the words ?radical Islam.? SLU students confirmed these details to YoungAmerica Foundation this week. The lecture, scheduled for September 29, is part of YoungAmericaFoundation Fred Allen Lecture Series that is bringing Lt. Col. West to campuses across the country this school year. YAF activists will not back down in the face of challenges from politically correct campus bureaucrats. Let me make myself very clear here, whomever this misguided soul is, he or she has picked the wrong fight. This reminds me of the statement by John Kerry that if the media justdidn talk about Islamic terrorism, it would not be an issue. This administratorat St. Louis University represents the most deplorable embodiment of fascism. Here we are less than a week from a weekend of Islamic terrorist attacks and this individual does not want students to have an in-depth discussion about the most serious, savage, and barbaric threat this Nation has faced ? well, at least since the Barbary Pirates. And who is this person who believes they have any right to prescribe to a campus student group what can be advertised for their lecture series? Is this what our country is coming to, and is this what parents who send their kids to St. Louis University are willing to accept?I honored YAF has chosen me to be the main speaker of their Fred Allen Lecture Series, and I take this responsibility seriously to educate and inform our young people of the current geopolitical situation ? after all, they are our future leaders. Now, who is this administratorwho claims Idon ?have the experience with radical Islam? ? Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot! Having served 22 years active service in the United States Army, to include combat tours of duty in the First Persian Gulf conflagration and commanding a Battalion in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And after retiring, I spent two and a half years in Afghanistan as a civilian/military advisor to the Afghan Army, based in Kandahar ? the place that was the capitol of the Taliban. Perhaps having served two years in Congress and sitting on the House Armed Services Committee is just not enough experience to be considered capable of addressing radical Islam. Or maybe, this administratorshould read the article I was asked to write by Military Review, the official professional journal of the US Army, for their January-February edition that addressed solutions to defeat ISIS ? a radical Islamic organization. I wonder if this administratorhas read, as I have several times, the MuslimBrotherhood Strategic Explanatory Memorandum for their engagement in North America ? the United States. Many nations, except the United States, have declared the Muslim Brotherhood an Islamic terrorist group. Bottom line, I want to know who this administratoris, and I demand he or she contact me directly. Sir orMa,I calling you out, and you tell me what about my service and experiences, in and out of uniform, disqualify me from addressing the issue of radical Islam, or Islamo-fascism, Islamic jihadism, or Islamic terrorism? The better question is, what do you think makes you experienced or qualified to make any judgement on me? Doggone right, I along with the YAF activists will not back down from this challenge. And if this is just a case of ill-conceived political correctness,we rectify that. But, if this is a case of the influence of stealth jihad radical Islamic campus organizations such as the Muslim Student Association, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, then you will be exposed. And I recommend to the President of St. Louis University, you do not want it known that a radical Islamic organization is dictating speakers on your campus ? that is not the type of PR you really want.I coming to St. Louis University next week, Thursday, September 29th.I be discussing radical Islam and its affects upon freedom in the United States and across the globe.I use my intellect, experiences, and historical reading to share with students so they can be better educated and informed. If someone wants to protest a retired Army officer exercising First Amendment free speech on a university campus ? feel free, butI take pleasure in ?",0.015942029,0.007246377,0.007246377,0.008695652,0.052173913,0.266666667,0.039130435,1,-1,1

"Story highlights Former Sen. John Warner is backing Hillary Clinton The Virginia Republican is crossing party lines New York (CNN) Former Sen. John Warner will endorse Hillary Clinton for president Wednesday morning, handing the Democratic nominee another high-profile Republican endorsement just 42 days before the election, CNN has learned. Warner will join his fellow Virginian and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine at a campaign event in Alexandria, Virginia -- a state Clinton is favored to win but that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been eyeing. A Clinton campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the forthcoming GOP endorsement, said that Warner's public show of support will help underscore that the former secretary of state has the temperament and experience to serve as president and head of the U.S. Armed Forces. Warner is a former US Navy secretary, who served 30 years in the Senate, most of those in a senior position on the Armed Services Committee. Several other former high-ranking Republicans have already endorsed Clinton over Trump including diplomat John Negroponte, who served under President Ronald Reagan and President George W.

"A shooter opened fire at the Cascade Mall on Friday night, killing five people and fleeing the scene of the crime. Dozens of police officers are currently searching for the gunman, described as a Hispanic man in his 20s or 30s. Authorities believe the man acted alone, thoughit possible that he received help, a spokesperson for the patrol, Sgt. Mark Francis, said in a midnight briefing outside the mall. ?I?d be extremely diligent and careful if you come in contact with the suspect,? Francis warned. ?Stay indoors, stay secure.? The shooter killed four women in the cosmetics department of aMacy department store at the Burlington shopping center, which is located 65 miles north of Seattle. Another man suffered critical injuries but passed away Saturday morning, Sgt. Francis said on Twitter. The gunman, armed with a long hunting rifle, left before police arrived. The mall was quickly evacuated around 8pm, minutes after the shooting took place. There has been no indication that the event was terror-related, Washington State Trooper spokeswoman Heather Axtman told NBC News, adding that the motive remains unclear. ?We?re still trying to gather as many witnesses as we can to get more information,? she said. Eric Mathews, 40, intended to meet his teenage son Kai at the mall on Friday night, arriving just as the shooting occurred. The two left before the mall was locked down, but four ofKai friends were stuck inside. ?Imagine I was late or if hedidn answer his phone,? Mathews told the NY Times, referring to his son. ?That stuff is running through my mind.? Tari Caswell was in theMacywomen dressing room when she heard the shots, ?like four balloons popping,? she told the Skagit Valley Herald. ?Then I heard seven or eight more, and I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it justdidn feel right. And it got very quiet,? she added. The investigation is ongoing, and the FBI has said early Saturday morning that it had ?no information to suggest that additional attacks,? were planned in Washington state. This is the second attack at a U.S. shopping mall in less than a week. Last Saturday an assailant stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minn. before an off-duty police officer intervened.

"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how wedon ?win anymore.? Wedon win on manufacturing. Wedon win on trade. Wedon win on economics. Wedon win against ISIS.It that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: ?Our militarycan beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying wecan beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. Wecan beat ? right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what ?they spinning right now.They watching.They spinning in their grave.? You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound likeyou assured them you can win here, andyou do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie?You ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness,you taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game. Simply act like we can win, andwe win.I sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the messagehe putting forth.He treating war, and terrorism, likethey football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like wecan beat ISIS,we beat them handily.That not true. Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. Wedidn. MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and wecouldn beat them with brute force. What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually ordered a retreat.Isn that giving up?Isn that whatyou railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great because of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because theydidn happen. Thenthere Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance,he reported to have said: ?We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.? Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said, ?Wecan beat ISIS.? Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team ?Wecan do this,? hands the game to the other team. Our militarydoesn operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS ? something you would know if youweren such a conceited bastard. On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it.It not a football game. ISIS is not WWII, andit definitely not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as suchdoesn just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows thatyou wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will never be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. As thoughit a goddamn football game.It not.

"Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a ?concentrated Satanic attack?? Yeah? Well, youaren alone. But good news folks, youdon have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord. On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already. Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a ?nationally known? preacher warned him ?that if you choose to run for president,there going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.? ?He saidthere going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level thatyou never seen before andI watching it every day,? Scott said.Scott wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: ?God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.? ?God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J.

"Trump suggests Tulsa officer was 'choking' in fatal shooting Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested that Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby may have choked when she shot dead Terence Crutcher on the side of a highway last week in Tulsa. Speaking at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee said, ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that. I'm very, very troubled by that. And we have to be very ? we have to be very careful."" Story Continued Below He added, ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing."" On Crutcher, he said, ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" Trump called, via Twitter, for an ""immediate end"" to the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, that broke out after a police shooting of a black man on Tuesday, the latest in a string of such fatal shootings that also included last week's shooting of Crutcher. ""Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, also writing, ""The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again."" Violent protests have rocked Charlotte in the past 24 hours, as demonstrators demand answers as to why Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday night in a parking lot of an apartment complex. Police said Scott was holding a gun, while his family said he was sitting in his car reading a book. That shooting follows the fatal incident in Tulsa, in which Crutcher was shot dead by Shelby on the side of a highway, after she claimed he was behaving strangely and feared he was reaching for a weapon. Trump, who has positioned himself as the ""law and order candidate,"" has been criticized in the past for what some see as opportunistic reactions to tragic events. Last month, he sparked outrage when he tweeted in response to a Chicago shooting which killed Nykea Aldridge, Dwyane Wade's cousin. He was accused of being insensitive, and using the incident to further his political agenda, tweeting, ""Dwayne [sic] Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!"" The Republican presidential nominee has, in recent weeks, been trying to appeal to black voters. Many denounced his comments Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, when he said that black communities in the United States are ""in the worst shape ever."" He raised similar controversy last month in another appeal to black voters when he said ""what the hell do you have to lose?"" by trying something new like Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who on Tuesday called Crutcher's shooting ""intolerable,"" also weighed in on Wednesday morning, tweeting, ""Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher.

Many people were shocked upon hearing this news. The golfing community is obviously devastated by the loss of such a legendary man. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Golf Association released a saddening yet inspirational statement. ?We are deeply saddened by the death of Arnold Palmer,golf greatest ambassador, at age 87,. Arnold Palmer will always be a champion, in every sense of the word. He inspired generations to love golf by sharing his competitive spirit, displaying sportsmanship, caring for golfers and golf fans, and serving as a lifelong ambassador for the sport. Our stories of him not only fill the pages ofgolf history books and the walls of the museum, but also our own personal golf memories. The game is indeed better because of him, and in so many ways, will never be the same.? He was known as ?the King of Golf?, but was known for much more than that. Palmer received many awards in the sport as well as outside the sport. Awards with high honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and more. Every time Palmer accepted these awards, he offered some golf tips to whoever presented him with theawards was most of the time the President of the United States! Anyone who came into contact with him, golfer or not, immediately encountered a good time. He knew how to relate to everyone, no matter the age, occupation or position they were in life. Palmer started out as an avid pilot who loved to play the game of golf. He attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship, which only grew his love for the sport even more. Palmer won his first tour during his rookie season in 1955, and the rest is history. Palmer brought a new attitude to golf. Unlike the other players, he took risks and tried things that ultimately may have made him look crazy from time to time. Hewasn your average straight laced golfer, andthat what made him rise to stardom as well as success in the golf world. Palmer had a major influence on practically every golfer in the world. Upon hearing the devastating news, American golfer, Tiger Woods, expressed how impactful Palmer has been over the years. ?Arnold meant everything to golf. Are you kidding me?. I mean, without his charisma, without his personality in conjunction with TV ? it was just the perfect symbiotic growth. You finally had someone who had this charisma, andthey capturing it on TV for the very first time. Everyone got hooked to the game of golf via TV because of Arnold.? Arnold will be missed by many people from many walks of life, as numerous people of high status and beyond have already started to mourn.

"Story highlights Congress and the White House are looking to finish a budget deal by Sept. 30 A dispute over assigning of website domain names is among obstacles to passage Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's campaign is weighing in at the 11th-hour of negotiations on Capitol Hill over government funding -- and one key sticking point: whether to allow an international consortium to take over the assigning of website domain names. In an unusual alliance, Trump is siding with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is leading the push to prevent it from taking effect Oct. 1. Congressional sources tell CNN that Trump's late effort to engage on this issue could throw the last-minute negotiations into flux. ""The US should not turn control of the Internet over to the United Nations and the international community,"" Trump's national policy director, Stephen Miller, said in a statement. ""President Obama intends to do so on his own authority -- just 10 days from now, on Oct. 1, unless Congress acts quickly to stop him. The Republicans in Congress are admirably leading a fight to save the Internet this week, and need all the help the American people can give them to be successful.""

"Trump: 'There?s nothing like doing things with otherpeople money' Donald Trump, in hot water over a report that his charity used donations to cover business-related legal fees, told a campaign rally crowd on Tuesday that ?there?s nothing like doing things with otherpeople money.? The comment about ?otherpeople money? came during a campaign rally in North Carolina, where Trump pledged to keep refugees from the Middle East out of the U.S. and instead put them in ?safe zones? that would be built with money from Gulf nations. It is a financial maneuver the real estate mogul said he has performed many times throughout his career. Story Continued Below ?It?s called OPM. I do that all the time in business.It called otherpeople money.There nothing like doing things with otherpeople money,? Trump said. ?Because it takes, the risk, you get a good chunk of it and it takes the risk.We going to do this, in this case, from a humanitarian standpoint. OPM: otherpeople money.? Under a Trump administration, the Gulf states would not be the only foreign countries on the hook to pay for the Manhattanbillionaire proposals. From the very beginning of his campaign, Trump has pledged to build a wall alongAmerica southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. DuringTrump visit to Mexico last month, Mexican President EnriquePe Nieto said his nation would not pay for the wall. Trump said the subject of who would pay was not discussed during their meeting.

"Clinton suggestsTrump rhetoric could be treasonous Trump fires back, accusing Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than terrorists. Hillary Clinton on Monday leveled some of her most charged attacks against Donald Trump yet, accusing the nominee of enabling Islamic State fighters with his rhetoric and hinting he may be committing treason. With a spate of domestic attacks over the weekend refreshing terror fears, Clinton and Trump hurled insults at each other on Monday, trying to convince voters that the other candidate would be a disastrous commander in chief. Story Continued Below Clinton held an impromptu news conference in the morning in which she presented herself as a steady hand in the face of terror threats and Trump as a reckless leader who is already making the United States less safe. ?We?ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists,? Clinton said. ?We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,? she added, using the constitutional definition of treason.Trump camp fired back, blaming Clinton for the rise of the Islamic State because she supported pulling back on troops in Iraq in 2011. ?HillaryClinton comments today accusing Mr. Trump of treason are not only beyond the pale,it also an attempt to distract from her horrible record on ISIS,?Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said. Trump himself piled on, trying to shame Clinton and tying her to President Barack Obama on the terrorism issue. ?Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything ? and blame anyone ? to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,? Trump said in a statement. ?The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking ISIS seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.? And during an afternoon rally in Florida, Trump accused Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than she has been on terrorists. ?Hillary talks tougher about my supporters than she does Islamic terrorists, right?? he said, to cheers. ?She called patriotic Americans who support our campaign, many of them cops and soldiers, deplorable and irredeemable, and she means it. Millions and millions of people,? Trump added, recalling remarks Clinton made earlier this month when she lumped half of his supporters into a ?basket of deplorables.? The heated language on both sides comes as each are trying to reassure rattled Americans that they are the most capable of stepping into the commander in chief role. The series of planted bombs around New York and New Jersey over the weekend as well as the mass stabbing at a Minnesota mall has freshly raised fears of the reach of the Islamic State, even though details are still emerging about the inspiration for the attacks. While Clinton tried to present herself as the clearheaded alternative toTrump reckless bombast, she also had to thread the needle when it comes to her own legacy as secretary of state andObama track record. ?This is a serious challenge,? Clinton told reporters, as she sought to reassure voters that the U.S. is on the right track in combating that challenge. ?We are well-equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.? She warned against getting ?diverted and distracted? by Trump's inflammatory words, and dismissedTrump attacks on her past efforts to combat terrorism while at the State Department. ?Well,it like so much else he says:It not grounded in fact.It meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,? Clinton said. ?I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work asI done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.? Clinton also suggested Americanswon hear heropponent plan, and not because it's secret. ?He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,? she said. ?Solet focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.? But Trump was eager to tether Clinton to Obama, and also pounced on a remark from White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who referred to the terrorism fight as a ?narrative battle? against whether the U.S. and the West is battling against the Muslim religion. ?I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say thatwe in a fight about ?narratives.? These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life,? Trump said.Trump running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, joined in the sniping, saying he was dumbfounded by the WhiteHouse use of the term ?narrative fight? and linking Clinton to it. ?I?m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know thatwe at war,? Pence told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. ?The White House spokesman today actually said that we were in a ? quote ? narrative fight, in a narrative battle. Idon even know what that is.?

Do ""the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they've produced and then refused to pay them?""

""It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you."" ""Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,"" Trump responded. Trump went on to suggest that he had only taken that route four times, and that he was within his legal rights to do so.

"NASCAR is under fire like never before, quite like this nation. Earlier this week we reported that NASCAR was getting sued $500 million after being accused of having unfair advantages for race car drivers. Specifically white race car drivers. Terrance Cox III, who is the CEO of Diversity Motorsports, filed the racial discrimination claim due to minorities being denied basically any chance in the sport of NASCAR. NASCAR quickly came out with a statement explaining why all of that was wrong.Here what Cox stated: ?In 2016, motorsports remain the most racially segregated sport in the United States. [NASCAR has] been complicit in, and supportive of, the racially discriminatory environment that virtually excludes African Americans from meaningful participation in motorsports racing in the United States.? NASCAR however completely disagrees seeing that they have programs designed specifically to end racial discrimination in the sport. ?Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders. We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission.? Whether we believe it or not, racial discrimination is still present here in America. NASCAR may not be guilty of it, but America as a whole is. Recently police in Charlotte, NC shot a black man and killed him. Keith Lamont Scott was approached by police when they were searching for a man under warrant. Scott was not the man they were looking for, but police stated that he appeared to be holding a gun. According to onlookers and family, Scott was reportedly holding a book that he was reading beforehand, and it looked like that was enough to lead policemen to believe it was a weapon. Because of this act, people of Charlotte were completely outraged. They began protesting on that day and have not stopped protesting since. Just last night, protesters went wild and violent. One person was shot while multiple shops and buildings were looted. One of those buildings was the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte. They have closed down for now, according to Bob Pockrass, reporter at ESPN. ?NASCAR has closed its Charlotte office for normal business today.

" The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs. The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria's civil war, for instance -- than what was discussed. To be fair, the debate was not intended to focus on international issues, which were basically a footnote in the ""securing America"" segment. But amid the exchanges about ISIS, Iran, NATO and nuclear proliferation, there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton. Fighting ISIS Trump to Clinton: You're going to stop ISIS? ""I don't think so."" https://t.co/iXIwDaIPem #DebateNight https://t.co/a0RbNrI174 For the most part, Trump focused on attacking Clinton's record -- ""she's got experience, but it's bad experience"" -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals. That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS, which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate. Clinton spoke of the need to ""intensify our air strikes against ISIS,"" ""support our Arab and Kurdish partners,"" and ""take out their leadership"" -- positions that don't differ much from President Barack Obama's current policies.

Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different, saying: ""we've got to work more closely with our allies"".

"I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. Story Continued Below So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. Buttoday Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action. Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at ?regime change.? She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as ?another Hitler.? She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself. In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees thatAmerica natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking. That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election. It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to comparePutin moves in Ukraine to what Hitlerdid insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin ?killing Russians,? a doubly illegal act of war. Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war. *** John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, ?Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.? Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war. But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our ?strategy of peace,? he said, was ?not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.? Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that ?our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish ourchildren future. And we are all mortal.? As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, ?we must reexamine our ownattitude individuals and as anation our attitude is as essential as theirs.? Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world. ?Our brave young men,? he said, ?are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.? He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. ?All this is our responsibility,? he said, ?not just anation responsibility but yours and mine.? John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death. The legacy of JFK & RFK is ?being abandoned bytoday Democratic Party.? Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned bytoday Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder. Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to seeAmerica unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations. Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilizationitself we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat. Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime existentialthreat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be existentialenemy. There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today. Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, ?on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.? Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade. But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day. For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives. And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger. *** So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again. We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China. President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and ourchildren future. Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted. But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land. Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, ?America first.? But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, ?There can be no business as usual with Russia.? Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time. And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King: Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests. Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization. Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations. This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties. Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both. Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations. Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

" The nation's billionaires -- energized by a presidential race heading down to the wire and led to believe that their money can tip the balance -- are digging deep. The investments come as the value of hefty fundraising and television advertising has been thrown into question this year thanks to Donald Trump's largely free-media driven campaign. Meanwhile, the failure of big-money candidates like Jeb Bush and the ability of Bernie Sanders to raise tens of millions of dollars from small donors underscored questions about whether big money packs the same punch this election cycle as it once did. But as Election Day nears, many of the top 1 percent decided they still think their checks matter. ""The fundraisers have been calling for a while. Now we're all kind of settled back in, the summer's over, and you look up and, man, this election's right on top of ya,"" said Steve Mostyn, a Democratic trial lawyer who gave $1 million to Hillary Clinton's super PAC and is prepared to give another $1 million to it before the election wraps. Mostyn, like other donors, said the increasing competitiveness of the presidential and Senate races made him feel he needed to join in. In a non-competitive race, an extra million might just be gravy. So Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist, committed another $15 million to his Democratic super PAC. The Ricketts family of the Midwest -- which financed substantial amounts of the barrage against Donald Trump during the Republican primary -- is now organizing millions to support him. And a batch of out-of-nowhere megadonors -- whether it's pro-Israel philanthropist Cherna Moskowitz on the right or Hollywood filmmaker Thomas Tull on the left ? are leaving their mark. Too much, too late? And TV, or not TV? Yet the biggest givers may have waited too long, depending on how they want to spend their money. With each passing week, the millions have smaller utility as advertising rates spike and early votes are cast. Steyer is an exception, routing his millions to his own personal super PAC, Next Gen Climate Action, along with a super PAC co-run with a labor unions, For our Future. Both of the groups are funneling their money into a field program -- not paid media. ""We believe in the traditional American democratic process where neighbors talk to neighbors about the most important issues affecting their lives,"" Steyer said in a statement to CNN. ""That's something you can't squeeze into a 15 second ad."" The other rising Democratic donor: Moskovitz, who sent ripples through the donor world when he pledged $20 million to a variety of liberal and Democratic Party groups, but didn't give to Clinton TV ad powerhouse Priorities USA. Moskovitz told CNN that he had ""nothing more to announce"" about any potential gift to Priorities. While he is ""primarily focused on the top"" of the ticket, he described Priorities as ""distinguished by focusing on TV more than anything else."" Bloomberg, the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor who has endorsed Clinton, does not plan to give to Priorities USA either, according to Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg political adviser. But he will likely end up spending $15 million for his Independence USA, Wolfson said. The group has already spent in Senate races for Republican incumbent Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, and is assessing whether to air advertisements in other states, Wolfson said. For the GOP, the pro-Trump, Ricketts-led effort, is a bet that TV does indeed work. The Ricketts are donating $1 million to their group, Future 45, and hope to raise a total of $25 million in this campaign's closing weeks. They plan to run ads in six states with competitive Senate races: Florida, Nevada, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Iowa, according to the head of the PAC, Brian Baker. It's unclear how many of the traditional donors that have been allied with the Ricketts family are following them into the fray. Future 45 was dormant for months after Trump won the nomination. Several major donors who have given to Ricketts-led groups in the past did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether they would fund Future 45. Some, like Home Deport founder Bernie Marcus and former US Senate candidate Linda McMahon, are publicly backing Trump and looking for ways to give. Others, like California investor Bill Obendorf and Chicago hedge funder Ken Griffin, are not. Offered a chance to say whether Griffin planned to support the group, a Griffin spokesman declined to comment. John Jordan, a California vinter and large Republican donor who has worked closely with the Ricketts family, said he regarded their political operation as savvy and effective. But he said that the late infusion of cash would have little impact. ""I feel bad for the people who wrote the checks,"" said Jordan. ""You can only spend so much effectively at the last minute."" Adelson's impact The decision by Adelson to partner with the Ricketts operation is a blow to the Trump super PACs that have been trying to land him as a landmark donor. One group, Rebuilding America Now, has secured million-dollar checks from Marcus thanks in part due to the fundraising skills of Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads the group. But many other well-heeled Trump supporters are still on the sidelines. Foster Friess, the Wyoming social conservative, told CNN earlier this month that while Scott's ""leadership is reassuring,"" he is not investing his dollars in the super PAC. A second group run by a billionaire family close to Trump, Bob and Rebekah Mercer, appears to be in favor, and they won a new $1 million last month from Moskowitz, a California philanthropist. She did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about her donation plans. The Adelson's gift to the pro-Trump effort -- likely to be around $5 million -- is substantially smaller than some had hoped, and the decision to relinquish control over their dollars to a separate donor family direct the effort is surprising. Yet some Democrats appear willing to go dollar-for-dollar with their Republican rivals. Mostyn, the Democratic lawyer who is hosting Tim Kaine for a fundraiser later this week in Houston, said he found the donation sizes of Adelson and Ricketts to be underwhelming, but that Trump's recent strength has him more eager to return fundraising calls. ""On my list of things to do today,"" Mostyn said, ""getting back to them has gone way up.""",0.024234694,0,0.00127551,0.012755102,0.044642857,0.238520408,0.006377551,2,-1,1
"4954 SHARES SHARES FacebookTwitter GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr For weeks, Donald Trump and his henchmen have tried to paint a picture of Hillary Clinton that suggestsshe physically and mentally unfit to be the next president. Whenever Clinton coughed, they would claim she had one foot in the grave. When she fainted on 9/11, Trump and his people were pounced with glee. Then we discover she tried to tough it out with walking pneumonia, and suddenly they turned that into an attack on her honesty. So going into the presidential debates, everyone was waiting for Trump to unleash some sort of attack onClinton health. And once it started to become apparent that he was losing the debate, the billionaire did just that. When addressing the issue of race in America, Trump said: ?You look at the inner cities, and I just left Detriot, and I just left Philidelphia. And Ijust know.You seen meI been all over the place. Uh, You decided to stay home and I meanthatokay I will tell you.I been all over andI met some of the greatest peopleI ever meet within these communities. And they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.?Clinton response was perfect. ?I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for?? There was a slight pause before she continued: ?I prepared to be president and I thinkthat a good thing.? The expression onTrump face followingClinton comeback was priceless. See for yourself. Some critics pointed out thatClinton ?gotcha line? came off as rehearsed. Butisn that sort of the point she was making? The point is that Clinton did rehearse, she studied, and prepared, not just for one debate, but also for an important job that entails far more significant consequences for bad decisions than low TV ratings and lawsuits. America saw just who the real adult was in this contest and at the end of the daythat the person you hire to do the most important job in the world. Featured image via YouTube.

"As news of more frequent police shootings appear in the media. People are asking why is this happening more now than before. Many theories have been proposed. More crime? more drug use.. and so on. There is one that has not been mentioned unitl now. You heard it here first. When did the police shootings begin to increase? Was it in the 2000s..? the teens? Or the 1960s..70s .. 80s or 1990s?? Even during the riotous years of the sixtys there were not as many LEO ..law enforcement officer ..shootings. I recall many years when officers said they had gone an entire career without firing their weapon on duty. A cursory search seems to indicate these shootings began more often from about the late 1980s on to present. That was about the same time an officer Dennis Tueller in Salt Lake City introduced his study on timing of attacks. This has become widely known among LEO departments all across the country as The Tueller Drill. This same drill is also trained in concealed carry classes. How long does it take an attacker to get to you from a standing position? Think about that for a moment, imagine a BG bad guy standing twenty one feet from you. He has a knife or a bat. How long do you think it would take? Tueller found that from about twenty one feet.. it takes an attacker about two seconds, or less to get to you. Two seconds. So beginning in the 1980s LEO depeartments begain to train officers in the Tueller Drill. Bad Guy. Knife. Twenty one feet. No warning signal. You act when he moves toward you. Draw and fire. Now you can see what I believe is one of the arguably biggest reasons for many of the now familiar shootings. This is not to condemn the Tueller drill or LEOs for using it. It is well founded an well reasoned. This is simply to inform why its happening . If anything the burden is on the guy standing in front of an officer.Don charge an officer. You will regret it.",0.028169014,0.014084507,0.018779343,0.014084507,0.056338028,0.267605634,0,2,-1,1
"MIAMI ? DonaldTrump aides are discussing the possibility of asking him to write his biggest check yet to his own campaign to fund an ad blitz, and the billionaire candidate is open to the possibility, according to three people close to the nominee. WhileTrump campaign has experienced a surge in small-dollar fundraising this month that could make an infusion of personal cash unnecessary, major Republican donors are nervous after a rocky first debate against Hillary Clinton and could ramp up pressure on their nominee to invest in the air war. Story Continued BelowTrump campaign last week said that it was planning a $140-million television and digital advertising push between this week and Election Day, in an effort to cut into the massive advertising advantage enjoyed by Clinton. But entering this month, the campaign did not have the money in the bank to pay for the effort, which would represent by far its most ambitious advertising push of the 2016 election.Trump most recent Federal Election Commission filing shows that his campaign had only $50 million in the bank at the end of August. Since then, his small-dollar online fundraising has been especially brisk, raising the prospect that Trump might not need to fund the ad buys from his own pocket ? or might only need to cover part of it, according to the three people close to the candidate. They suggested that Trump is amenable to either possibility ? even if it means writing his biggest check of the campaign to date. Trump relied heavily on his own fortune through the bitter GOP primary, during which he loaned his campaign $43.5 million of his own money. A central tenet of his candidacy was that his ability to self-finance his White House bid made him independent from major donors to whom he suggested his rivals were beholden. Since then, though, Trump has scaled back his self-financing, giving his campaign only about $2 million a month, which he has cast as putting up his own money to match contributions from small donors. Republican insiders in interviews have expressed doubt aboutTrump willingness to inject larger sums of his own cash into the race. His campaign issued another monthly $2-million challenge to small donors on Tuesday, promising in an email that their contributions ?will be instantly matched for double the impact in our race to defeat Hillary Clinton.? Indeed, in combination with the Republican National Committee, the campaign has invested heavily in a small-dollar online fundraising operation, which has produced big numbers, and has helped narrowClinton gaping fundraising lead. The Trump campaign declined to comment on its September fundraising or how much of his own money Trump was prepared to spend. One of the people close to Trump said the real estate developer and reality TV star is ?prepared to do whatever it takes personally to win. But the cash has been pouring in and we have a lot more cash than people think. Now,there actually cash there to pay for the $140 million.? The person rejected a suggestion that the $140-million advertising plan was not realistic, but rather was intended to assuage worried donors and to worryClinton forces. ?That was not a head fake,? said the person. Still,Trump team has only slowly begun investing in some of the trappings of traditional presidential campaigns, and he continues to brag about how littlehe spent relative to Clinton. The Democrat, Trump alleged duringMonday debate has ?spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.? Yet, he said, ?the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money ? I'm either winning or tied. AndI spent practically nothing.? In fact,Trump campaign had spent $119 million overall through the end of August, but its advertising budget has been a fraction of that ofClinton campaign. Through the end of last week,Clinton campaign had spent more than five times the $22 million that Trump has spent on TV and radio ads for the general election, according to Kantar Media. And the gap appears to be widening, even asTrump fundraising has taken off. In the 10 days leading up to the debate,Clinton campaign aired 12,812 ads on local television in the 61 top markets, compared to 1,378 for Trump, according to the tracking company Media Monitors. Trump's planned $140-million ad buy will focus on 13 states, including battlegrounds like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also Maine, New Mexico and Wisconsin, according to an Associated Press report. Jessica Ditto, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told POLITICO that last week it began reserving $100 million in television advertising and $40 million in digital ads, with the first $15-million-worth placed Friday. ?The broadcast/cable ratio will continue to fluctuate in line with targeting needs,? Ditto said. Ad buying data provided to POLITICO does not reflect the full weight of the buy yet. It indicates thatTrump campaign has purchased roughly $9.8 million in advertising between Tuesday and Election Day, compared to $41 million over that same period forClinton campaign.",0.023890785,0,0,0.018771331,0.039249147,0.252559727,0.003412969,2,-1,1
" DonaldTrump efforts to attract any kind of support from the African-American community has not gone well.

"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a blackpresident birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur? First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaiididn exist when it was ?issued.? Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? No, only a cry of racism when the request is made. Theycan produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of birtherand racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of. Sadly, Donald Trump has bowed to their?

"With the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debates upon us, the quadrennial question comes begging: Do these showdowns matter? Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The chances for impact seem ripe this year. The two most unpopular major-party candidates in the history of ABC News/Washington Post polls are facing off. Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign style and provocative positions have piqued public interest; the debates may be the single best opportunity for him to allay concerns about his qualifications, temperament and policy promises alike. Hillary Clinton, for her part, needs -? like Trump -? to ease questions about her trustworthiness, as well as to spark greater enthusiasm among her supporters. Can either candidate move the needle? It will be tough: A review of data since 1960 suggests that past debates have almost never directly and measurably changed the candidates' relative standings. That's admittedly a high standard, though, and at least some debates may have had more subtle impacts. Debates have been held in 11 presidential races since 1960. We find just one after which the lead in presidential preference changed hands by a significant margin: In 1980, when Ronald Reagan uttered his ""are you better off?"" line. He gained 7 points in a post-debate poll. Still, there are other cases in which debates (or post-debate evaluations) may have influenced campaign dynamics. Debates are, after all, an essential window on the candidates? styles and grasp of the issues. They can seem to add or reverse momentum. And polls are only so precise. Consider 1960: After RichardNixon pasty-faced performance, John F. Kennedy went from 46 percent support to 49 percent in Gallup data; Nixon, from 47 percent to 46 percent. Those changes were within the polls' margin of sampling error. Nonetheless, the numerical ""lead"" switched, and collective memory maintains that the debates spelled Nixon's narrow defeat. Nor did Gallup polls show significant movement immediately after the 1976 debate in which Gerald Ford said Poland was free (and news reports pounced on the misstatement); Jimmy Carter gained a single point, Ford lost 3. Still, even if not measurably, the gaffe may have halted what had been a slide in Carter's lead. Then 73-year-old Reagan's teasing jibe in 1984 about 56-year-old Walter Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" didn't meaningfully change the numbers in ABC News/Washington Post polls, but perhaps helped put aside questions about Reagan's age and acuity. In 2000, Al Gore's wonk-heavy performance saw him go in at +2 and leave at -3, but again, that was within sampling error. There's also the question of missed opportunities, as in Mike Dukakis' bloodless answer, in 1988, to what he'd do if his wife were raped and murdered. He didn't seize on the chance to show a non-technocratic side. And ABC/Post polls did not meaningfully move. ABC News/Washington Post polls in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012 also showed no significant movement around the debates. In 1992 there was more movement, including a significant gain for Ross Perot, but never enough to change BillClinton advantage. In instant reactions, at least, polling has found that debates typically reinforce preconceived notions rather than change them. Most of each candidates' supporters say it's their candidate who won, and precious few say their minds were changed. But post-debate evaluations can shift. In 1992, right after the first debate, 24 percent of viewers said Perot had won. By the next night, amid positive reviews of Perot's performance, that grew to 37 percent among people who'd watched, heard or read about it. And Perot's support did advance, from 6 percent before the debates to 17 percent after them. That shift may have been real, but it also may have reflected the challenges of immediate post-debate reaction polls. Conducted in mere minutes, among individuals pre-recruited to participate, they're subject to considerable sampling and weighting limitations. Further, some ask who ""won,"" others who ""did the better job""; some accept ""tie"" as an answer and some don't. Instant reactions also bypass the role of considered judgment. Hard as it may be to believe in the Twitter Age, sometimes people actually need a little while to think about things. The clearest response to the debates this year may take some days to emerge. Rundown Here's a rundown of the measurable debate effect (or lack thereof) in each election since 1960. There were no debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. Click here for data tables associated with each election. 1960: Gallup had Nixon +1, but that was 12 days before the first debate; it had Kennedy +3 after it. Twelve days is a long time and 4 points is a small number. Gallup didn't poll between the remaining three debates, but showed Kennedy +4 after the last one. 1976: News reports jumped on Ford's misstatement of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in the second debate. Carter's lead had been diminishing, and that did stop after this debate. But the measured change after the second debate was tiny -- Carter gained 1 point, Ford lost 3. 1980: This one looks to have mattered: Gallup's pre-debate poll had Carter +8; post-debate, Reagan +3. (John Anderson did not participate.) 1984: Mondale crept up, but Reagan stayed ahead by double digits nonetheless. 1988: We don't have an ABC poll done right before the first debate; in a Gallup poll it was George H. W. Bush +8. Our poll after the second debate showed no meaningful movement. 1992: Perot moved up 5 points in ABC News polling after the first debate and 4 points after the third debate. Before the debates he had 6 percent support; after the last debate he was up to 17 percent. Clinton moved up by 5 points after the second debate, Bush down by 6, then Clinton down by 6 after the third. But Clinton led throughout. 1996: The race looked perhaps slightly tighter after the second debate, but Clinton maintained a double-digit lead throughout. 2000: Gore went in +2 and came out -3 -? a change of lead, but within sampling error. And a week after the last debate it was back to a dead heat, 47-47 percent. 2004: There were some wiggles in the debate period ?- a 6-point lead for George W. Bush before the first debate was a dead heat before the third -? but when all was said and done the race after the debates looked a lot like the race before them. 2008: The main shift in vote preference came before the first debate, as Obama seized the reins of economic discontent after the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. McCain's +2 in early September, just after the GOP convention, proved to be his best. The race shifted to Obama +9 in an ABC/Post poll completed Sept. 22, four days before the first debate. Obama never trailed again. 2012: Obama was +2 ahead of the first debate in ABC/Post polls, within the margin of sampling error, +3 after the second debate and -1 after the final debate, all within sampling error.",0.017817372,0,0.001113586,0.013363029,0.056792873,0.230512249,0.006681514,2,-1,1
"Hillary Clinton Says HIGHER ESTATE TAXES For Everyone, Except Her Family? Thereshouldn be an estate tax period. Right now the rate stands at 40%. If Hillary Clinton gets her way,she raise it to a whopping 65% and I would not be surprised to see it go even higher. We are being taxed to death and Hillary loves taxes. Taxation equals slavery? it is enforced compliance and I view it as unconstitutional. But these rulesdon apply to elitists such as the Clintons who are now definitely in the top 1% of the wealthy out there. They have several tax shelters that keep this from applying to them.Isn that nice? I guess when they kick off, they want to make sure that Chelsea gets their wealth. But itisn just the estate tax with these people? they have accounting methods that shield them from almost all taxation. From Breitbart: Hillary Clinton wants to increase the estate tax to 65 percent on the wealthiest Americans, according to her latest tax plan. The Clinton campaign estimates that the increase would raise an addition $75 billion in revenue over the next decade. The current rate maxes out at 40 percent. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now But Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill have created a number of tax shelters in recent years to dramatically limit their payment of the very same tax. As Bloomberg reported back in 2014: ?To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth.? In 2010 the Clinton created ?residential trusts? and the following year moved their Chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records. As David Scott Sloan, a partner at the firm Holland Knight explained the Clinton trust to CBS News, ?You?re creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.? The move will save the Clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, according to accountants quoted by Bloomberg. These types of taxation shelters are common among the wealthy. They do not typically apply to the rest of us. If Clinton could get away with it, she would impose a 100% tax rate. In essence, they are already doing that by using multiple layers of taxation. Creative accounting seems to only apply to the wealthy. Those who see themselves as above the rule of law.

"A Daisy of a Rerun I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her. The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson approvedthat message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly ?war mongering? opponent, Barry Goldwater. Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisitingJohnson deceitful war policies,Goldwater vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from ourNation media. I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a Daisyremake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers. Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweighGoldwater 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. Instead,today voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as ?news and views.? With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, themedia reaction of ridicule was to be expected. Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailingTed ?dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.? This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a ?pathological liar? and ?utterly amoral.? As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of ??Lyin Ted,? insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.? These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say derogatorywhen regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the ?liberal press? moniker has now everyday acceptance. It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for thepublic re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation. Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format andr?s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion. These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. With that, consider thePresident past considerations oftoday democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, ?She will say anything and change nothing. Hillarycan be trusted andisn qualified to be President.? Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent,it damning, given the time frame. Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: ?If youcan run your own house, you certainlycan run the White House.? Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. Again,wouldn it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer. H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician ? ?down.? Likewise,there really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump ? an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity. Story Continued Below Yeah, yeah, yeah,it a big night for Hillary Clinton too.She got a lot to prove, for real, namely thatshe not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is ? or at least convince the 55 percent of voters whodon like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convincewhoever still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) thatshe not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible. But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency.She been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples. Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box ? running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness).He bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student whodoesn read books, has the sketchiest sense of history,doesn read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters,can even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting andTrump own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday ? but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States? 1. Does he actually know ? or care to know ? the basic information needed to competently run the country? Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, andthat acandidate capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump ? who swooned afterClinton superb convention in Philly ? has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1.He still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing. His resurgence proves three political points ? two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and ? lastly, but not leastly ? Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to. The first debate should be a pivot ? from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidateisn remotely the same thing as being ready to rule ? and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probablywon happen, but a boy can dream. This is not to suggest that Trumpcan do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), buthe been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence. Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs ? apparently hewasn aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates ? but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) puncturedTrump bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trumpwasn aware of that fact, or justdidn care. The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. ?All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,? said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. ?When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.? Stone argued that Trumpisn an ignoramus ? just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W.Bush advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said thatBush unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.Trump capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless ? butthere not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job. Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows whatHUD Section 8 program is ? and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. Butdon people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms ? by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate? 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: ?We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace ? we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.?That a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: ?For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ?actual malice? ? that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.? During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for ?Article 12 of the Constitution.? The framers stopped at seven. ?He was just listing out numbers,? said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. ?I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.? OK,let write that one off as a gotcha ? you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where ?some bad things are happening.? The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the ?Free Exercise? clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds. 3. Whywon Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs ? and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism. But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one. Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue isTrump fundamental personal narrative, and his claim thathe ?very, very rich.? He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he sayshe good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets sayhe worth less than half that much). More serious is the issue ofTrump debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. Ifthat a lie,there an easy way to prove it ? by releasing the returns. Thisisn a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast. 4.What the deal with his charitable foundation? Thenthere the matter ofTrump sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos? after expos?, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees forTrump businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal. The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others. 5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system. But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statementshe made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts. Hillary Clinton (?Crooked Hillary? inTrump parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint ? far from it ? and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators. Butit a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness ? especially George W.Bush claims about Iraq ? would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation ofTrump whoppers would take up too much space ? readPOLITICO comprehensive ?DonaldTrump Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths? for a taste.) In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to beTrump running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. ?Clinton,? the former speaker wrote, ?is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing?? But getting the facts right ? and telling the truth ? is a big thing.It the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.",0.022803488,0.008718981,0.010731053,0.011401744,0.052313883,0.286384977,0.002012072,2,-1,1
"2016 Clinton vs. Trump: The only 30 minutes that matter Most of the big debate moments in history came in theencounter opening rounds, something Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would do well to remember. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will debate for 90 minutes on Monday. But the winner likely will be determined in the first half-hour.That when Al Gore first sighed, Mitt Romney knocked President Barack Obama on his heels, and Marco Rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point ? over and over and over.It when Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade George W.Bush space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators? introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, ?There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.? Story Continued Below Veteran presidential debate coaches and campaign strategists say the tone and trajectory of general election debates have long been set in their opening minutes, and that the explosion of real-time spin and Twitter groupthink has only accelerated the trend. And so, as Clinton and Trump square off Monday at Hofstra University before a national audience that is expected to shatter viewership records, the pressure will be especially intense right at the start. ?You have your maximum audience at its most impressionable stage in the first minutes of the debate,? said Mari Maseng Will, a veteran Republican debate coach who served as communications director in the Reagan White House. Campaigns now specially design one-liners for those crucial opening minutes and map out plans to pivot to safer ground if the early questioning veers into rockier political terrain, such as, say, classified emails for Clinton or charges of misogyny for Trump. In a sign of the warp speed in which debate storylines can form, BuzzFeed in 2012 famously posted a story with the headline, ""How Mitt Romney Won the First Debate,"" only 42 minutes into the first Obama-Romney clash in Denver. Kevin Madden, then a senior Romney adviser, said the campaign could see the conventional wisdom hardening among the chattering class online in real time. ?It was clear Romney was going to be declared the winner no matter what happened in the other 60 minutes, barring any big mistakes,? Madden said. (Romney fell victim to this, too, when he spent the first half of his final encounter largely agreeing with Obama and was portrayed as overly ?passive.?) Debate pros, much like courtroom lawyers, have a name for this: ?the primacy effect.?It the idea that whatever is heard first is likely to be what is best remembered. ?In debates and in trial work,there the doctrine of primacy,? said Judd Gregg, who played Gore inBush mock debate preparations in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. ?If you do a good job ? or a really bad job ? it will stay with the viewer.? How long, exactly, Clinton and Trump have to form that first impression is the subject of, well, some debate. Todd Graham, a presidential debate junkie and director of debate at Southern Illinois University, where his teams have won five national championships, estimated that candidates have about 45 minutes. ?The first half of the debate is absolutely the most important,? Graham said. Examples are plentiful.Reagan classic 1984 line, ?I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,? came just before the halfway point. In 2000, Gore began making off-camera sighs and split-screen smirks in the opening minutes of the first general election debate, expressions of exasperation that would come to define his bouts with Bush. Bush, meanwhile, quickly landed lines aboutGore ?phony numbers? and, later, ?fuzzy math? that would be endlessly repeated. Then, early in their third debate, Gore physically approached Bush in an act of intimidation that backfired at the town-hall style debate. Bush glanced over and gave Gore a quick, dismissive nod that drew laughs from the crowd as Gore gamely still tried to corner Bush on obscure specifics. ?What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?? Gore demanded, before eventually retreating to his chair. Bush never answered. Hedidn need to. The early minutes proved critical in some of thisyear primary debates, too. In February, ChrisChristie campaign-crushing retort toRubio repeating of a talking point ? ?There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody? ? came fewer than 20 minutes into the two-hour debate. Rubio never recovered that night, or the rest of the campaign. Curt Anderson, chief strategist for Bobby Jindal, who appeared in the so-called undercard debates, said the bias toward the beginning was striking. ?There?s this whole Twitterverse dynamic whereit decided in the opening minutes.It not rational or fair, and you can bitch all you want about it, but you have to adjust and deal with it,? he said. By the end,Jindal team designed its debate strategy around landing its weightiest punches early. In the most extreme of cases, an entiredebate storyline can be sealed after a single question. In 1988, the very first question asked of Michael Dukakis was whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were ?raped and murdered.? Without any visible emotion, he said he would not. (?When he answered by talking policy, I knew we had lost the election,? Dukakis? campaign manager would later say.) In 2012, BuzzFeed famously posted a story with the headline, ""How Mitt Romney Won the First Debate,"" only 42 minutes into the first Obama-Romney clash in Denver. | Getty In the 2012 primaries, CNN opened a debate by asking Newt Gingrich about allegations that he had once wanted an open marriage. ?I think the destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office. And I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that,? Gingrich bellowed to thunderous applause. Two days later, Gingrich, who had been left for dead politically after losing Iowa and New Hampshire, won the South Carolina primary. There are other practical reasons why early minutes matter most: Voters can change the channel, and reporters have to start crafting their stories. ?Reporters are lazy, and they have deadlines, and those two things combined ? theydon have all night,? said Graham, who said he watches and reads post-game punditry and ?95 percent of people are talking about what happened in the first 45 minutes.? In 2012, Rentrak, which tracks television viewership, found that the average home watched only two-thirds of the first debate, though there was no precipitous drop-off over time. But by the third debate, the company reported ?the audience justdidn stay tuned in as long.? There have been key moments late in presidential debates, or course.Reagan ?There you go again? quip to Jimmy Carter in 1980 came late. George H.W. Bush glanced down at his watch when, deep into a 1992 debate, a voter was asking him a question.

"New York  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off for the first time on the debate stage Monday night, the biggest moment of the already extraordinary 2016 presidential race. With national polls showing a tight race just six weeks out from Election Day, the Hofstra University fight offers one of the last chances for each to speak directly to the tens millions of voters who are expected to tune in. For Clinton, a veteran debater, one of her biggest challenges will be both to provoke Trump and avoid being provoked by him, while delivering an earnest and candid performance. And for Trump, who had uneven and at times explosive debate performances during the Republican primary, his first one-on-one debate presents a serious test of his ability to stay on script and keep his cool. Here are five things to watch at Monday night's debate: Which Donald Trump will show up? During the long Republican primary, there was no telling which Trump would show up to a debate. Sometimes it was the combative and hostile Trump -- quick to throw punches and go after his opponents with personal attacks. Other times, it was an uncharacteristically subdued Trump, content to disappear from the spotlight for long stretches of time and let his competitors command the stage and attack one another. ""We are preparing for different Trumps that might show up,"" Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters last week. ""He may be aggressive or he may lay back and that's hard to game out."" JUST WATCHED Top advisers to Obama, Bush preview Monday's debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Top advisers to Obama, Bush preview Monday's debate 07:58 Being overtly antagonistic toward Clinton would be a risky move for Trump. If he is unable to keep calm and stay focused, it will only feed the narrative that he lacks the temperament to be president and potentially make him look small next Clinton, who is famous for being measured. Trump also won't have the option of sitting on the sidelines. As one of only two candidates on stage, the Republican nominee must make the most of every minute allotted to him and show a level of agility and rapid-response instincts that was far less critical on a debate stage with numerous candidates. Monday night will pose a critical test for Trump, who has so far shown a relative lack of depth on policy. With approximately half of the debate's 90 minutes dedicated to the GOP nominee, it will be far more difficult than in past debates for Trump to get by with sweeping statements that he is accustomed to making at rallies and in interviews, particularly given that Clinton's strong suit is policy. Can Clinton heed Obama advice to 'be yourself?' No one understands Clinton's debating chops better than President Barack Obama, who faced off against her numerous times in the 2008 election. Obama's advice to Clinton for Monday? ""Be yourself and explain what motivates you,"" the President told ABC's Robin Roberts last week . ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. There's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who I know."" So far in this campaign, Clinton has struggled to do precisely that, and appearing unguarded and likeable -- fairly or not -- has been one of her biggest political challenges. There's no question that policy is Clinton's forte -- aides to the former senator and secretary of state describe her as a wonk who knows policy inside and out. As she marshals her fluency in policy, she will want to avoid coming off as lecturing or smug, the way critics say Al Gore did in his debates with George W. Bush. But appearing next to Trump could help make Clinton more likable by comparison: Polls show that a majority of voters question Trump's temperament and view him as appealing to bigotry. The Clinton campaign says it plans to drive home the point that Trump habitually makes factually inaccurate statements. ""Donald Trump has pattern of repeating lies hoping no one will correct him,"" Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, said on a call with reporters last week. ""This warrants particular focus because his level of lying is unprecedented in American politics."" Clinton has acknowledged that she doesn't have the natural charisma of Obama or her husband, Bill Clinton, but she has fleshed out her personal story and offered a sharper positive message in recent weeks, and she will likely attempt to continue that effort on Monday. Things could get really personal The 2016 election has already showcased a whole lot of nasty name-calling, but Monday night has the potential to descend into the worst mudfight yet. Even before the debate had begun, the two campaigns were in full trolling mode. The Clinton campaign offered Mark Cuban -- the TV celebrity billionaire who recently endorsed the Democratic nominee -- a front row seat at Hofstra. Cuban has been relentless in attacking Trump-- in July, he said Trump ""went off the reservation and went bats -- crazy"" -- and he has also called out Trump for not releasing his tax returns. JUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23 Having Cuban in the front row is the kind of mind game that the Clinton camp hopes will distract and throw Trump off his game. But in Trumpian fashion, the GOP nominee responded over the weekend by threatening to bring Gennifer Flowers as his guest to the debate. Flowers is a former Arkansas state employee who claimed to have had a multi-year sexual relationship with Bill Clinton. The former president has admitted to having a sexual encounter with her. The Trump campaign later said it won't invite Flowers to the debate. Still, Trump's comments may foreshadow his willingness to dredge up some of the most painful incidents from the Clintons' past, including Bill Clinton's various indiscretions. Hillary Clinton, too, could go there if provoked -- Trump has been married three times and has two messy divorces under his belt; has openly boasted in the past about his playboy lifestyle. Moreover his offensive remarks about women and minorities are part of her campaign's argument he is temperamentally unfit to be president. Asked by CNN on her plane earlier this month whether she believes it is fair game to go after Trump's personal life, Clinton didn't rule out the possibility. Trump, meanwhile, said on Fox News last week: ""If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect."" The politics of race There's no shortage of top-tier issues -- terrorism, Syria, ISIS, immigration, the economy among them -- but the first general election match-up comes amid national outrage sparked yet again by police killings of African-American men. The recent deaths of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina and Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma have sparked fresh and impassioned calls for justice and protests that have at times turned violent. With the issue of police force -- particularly toward minorities -- dominating headlines, the politics of race is guaranteed to be a discussion topic. Both Clinton and Trump had planned to visit Charlotte -- where Scott was killed -- around the debate: Clinton on Sunday and Trump on Monday. But both campaigns scrapped those plans after Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN's Erin Burnett that the city was too stretched on resources. For both Clinton and Trump, the challenge will be to offer detailed proposals on how they would address unnecessary police violence and thoughtfully speak to a grieving community. It also gives both a chance to make arguments to key constituencies -- Clinton to African-Americans who voted with Obama, and Trump to GOP base voters with his ""law and order"" pitch. The debate will likely delve into many other policy issues including healthcare, trade, economy and foreign policy. But many of the core disagreements between Trump and Clinton are rooted in the different ways in which they view race and inclusion. The two nominees have starkly contrasting views on immigration, for example, and how to handle people who enter the country illegally. They also clash on the national security front ? particularly on how they want to combat terrorism. Clinton has urged measured responses that ensure that an entire religion is not villanized -- Trump, meanwhile, has suggested using methods of racial profiling and keeping out entire ethnic groups as a safety measure. All eyes on Lester Holt No one who will face more pressure Monday night than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- except Lester Holt The NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor and veteran newscaster is about to enter uncharted territory as the moderator of the first Clinton-Trump face-off. Monday will mark Holt's first time presiding over a general election presidential debate; some 70 to 100 million people are expected to tune in; and there is no telling what dynamics will drive ultimately drive the prime-time event. Both campaigns have preemptively cranked up the heat, suggesting that Holt and the other moderators might be less than fair to their respective candidates. Palmieri told reporters last week that her biggest concern heading into the debate is that Trump and Clinton will be graded on different curves.

"If convicted, Betty Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. | AP Photo Tulsa police officer charged with first-degree manslaughter in man's death TULSA, Okla. ? Prosecutors charged a white Oklahoma police officer with first-degree manslaughter Thursday, less than a week after she fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street and just days after police released graphic videos, saying in court documents that the officer ""reacted unreasonably."" Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Tulsa officer Betty Shelby in the Sept. 16 shooting death of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher. Kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for Shelby's surrender. Story Continued Below Shelby ""reacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with Mr. Crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands held up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she over reacted,"" according to an affidavit filed with the charge. The swift action in Tulsa stood in contrast to Charlotte, North Carolina, where police refused under mounting pressure Thursday to release video of the shooting of another black man this week and the National Guard was called in to try to a head off a third night of violence. Demonstrations in Tulsa since Crutcher's death have been consistently peaceful. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. The footage does not offer a clear view of when Shelby fired the single shot that killed Crutcher. Her attorney has said Crutcher was not following police commands and that Shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his SUV window. But Crutcher's family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers. They also pointed to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show Crutcher's window was rolled up. And police said Crutcher did not have gun on him or in his vehicle. An affidavit filed Thursday says Shelby told police homicide investigators that ""she was in fear for her life and thought Mr. Crutcher was going to kill her. When she began following Mr. Crutcher to the vehicle with her duty weapon drawn, she was yelling for him to stop and get on his knees repeatedly."" Crutcher was wearing ""baggy clothes"" but that Shelby ""was not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present,"" the affidavit states. Among the definitions in Oklahoma for first-degree manslaughter is a killing ""perpetrated unnecessarily either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a crime, or after such attempt shall have failed."" If convicted, Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett said police worked quickly to provide Kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. ""I appreciate their efforts as well as the District Attorney's usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable,"" Bartlett said in a written statement. ""These are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevails. ""We will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice."" Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, was en route to a domestic violence call when she encountered Crutcher's vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashboard camera, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. The police footage shows Crutcher approaching the driver's side of the SUV, then more officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. A man inside a police helicopter overhead says: ""That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something."" Police Sgt. Dave Walker has said investigators found a vial of the drug PCP in Crutcher's vehicle. Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, has said that Shelby completed drug-recognition expert training and thought Crutcher was acting like he might be under the influence of PCP. Attorneys for Crutcher's family said the family didn't know whether drugs were found in the SUV, but that even if they were, it wouldn't justify the shooting. A toxicology report could take several weeks. In the videos, the officers surround Crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. A voice heard on police radio says: ""Shots fired!"" The officers back away and Crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,"" Kunzweiler said. ""It's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process."" At least two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse after the district attorney announced the charges, with some saying they were not happy that Shelby wasn't charged with first-degree murder. ""We will be out here every single day until she gets murder,"" Tulsa resident Tammi Sims said.

One question on the mind of many is why would the Clinton IT staff plead the 5th? Based on this report from the NY Post, we may have part of our answer: The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log intoClinton server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013.

"The Black Lives Matter movement is quick to cry foul whenever black people appear to be stereotyped. But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman. That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire. Dow passed away in the hospital recently from complications from the attack. Her attackers are now being charged with murder. Justin Grady, age 38, Cortavious Deshaun Heard, age 18, Mina Christine Ellery, age 17 and Angel Latrice Harmon age 17 are all being held without bond on charges of ""felony murder and malice murder."" The group entered Dow's home and pulled her from her bed where she was sleeping. One of the gang hit her repeatedly with a pistol, breaking the bones in her hand and her arm. Then Dow was covered in a flammable material and set on fire. She survived burning to death only because she pulled herself to a place where she knew she had kept a gallon jug of water. There she was able to pour the water on herself and put out the fire. Then, with a broken arm, she crawled to her cellphone and dialed 911. The local news station gives no reasoning about why the attack occurred, but as we well know, had the races been reversed, the entire country would be burning from the Black Lives Matter protests. We need to stop with this duplicitous nature in America. Death is wrong. Violence is wrong.

"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a ?powerful hate group,? has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is thisauthor contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get ?Hillary the Horrible? into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone ? especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President ? to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters ? but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens ? to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party,America most powerful ?Hate Group,? not only wants ?Hillary the Horrible? to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

"New York  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals. Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks. Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday. Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader. ""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over."" He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones. Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president. Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi. While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting. ""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said. The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added. The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East."" Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month. Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."" Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House. ""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins."" The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady. Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President EnriquePe Nieto earlier this year. The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, butPe Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it. Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident."" ""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting. For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials. Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself. Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians. Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration. Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS."" Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country. Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace. Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally. ""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said. Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished. Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path. Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected. There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.",0.032598274,0.004793864,0.004793864,0.009587728,0.054650048,0.334611697,0.008628955,2,-1,1
"Cities across the country suffered an uptick in violent crime last year, including a nearly 11 percent jump in murders from the year before, according to new statistics compiled by the FBI. There were 1,197,704 violent crimes committed around the nation last year -- a 3.9 percent increase from 2014, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. However, last year's statistics were still slightly lower than in 2011, and more than 16 percent below the 2006 level, the FBI said today. It's important to note that big jumps in violent crime in only a handful of U.S. cities can drive the national average up. Some cities, like Chicago and Los Angeles, saw more than 24,000 violent crimes each last year, while so many other cities and towns across the country experienced single-digit or no violent crimes at all. Overall, murders accounted for nearly 15,700 of last year's violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of them were committed with firearms, according to the FBI report. ""The report shows that there was an overall increase in violent crime last year, making clear what each of us already knows: that we still have so much work to do,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a violent-reduction summit in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""But the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014. And it is important to remember that while crime did increase overall last year, 2015 still represented the third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades."" Lynch said the nation must not become ""complacent"" about violent crime. ""The residents of communities where violence remains a fact of daily life care little whether overall crime rates are up and down,"" she said. ""And in the raft of data and analysis that can so often define our work, we must never forget that all of our numbers reflect the lives of real people."" She emphasized that ""there is no single cause of violence, and solutions will vary from one community to another.""",0.038910506,0.015564202,0.007782101,0.007782101,0.058365759,0.342412451,0,2,-1,1

""Police kill almost three people everyday,"" McKesson told POLITICO, as unrest simmers over the two deaths of black men by police over the past week. ""We have to hold the police accountable for their actions."" Story Continued Below Protests shook the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, overnight and into the early morning after a black man was shot dead by police Tuesday night. The demonstrations, which at times turned violent, spilled over into the apartment complex where Keith Lamont Scott was killed. Charlotte police maintain that Scott stepped out of his vehicle with a gun when officers arrived at the scene, but his family disputes this claim, saying he was sitting in his car reading a book. The Charlotte Police Department could not be immediately reached for comment. The shooting comes as racial tensions were already high across the country after police shot dead an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma last week. Terence Crutcher's family says officer Betty Shelby inappropriately fired on him after their SUV broke down, while her lawyer contends that Crutcher was acting suspiciously and appeared to be reaching inside the vehicle for a gun. While the shootings have again grabbed national headlines ? and attention from the two presidential candidates ?

""[I'm] looking forward to how this plays out in terms of criminal charges,? said McKesson, who was an early leader of the Black Lives Matter movement and co-founded Campaign Zero, the first effort to organize activists around a set of policies to stop police violence. McKesson said while the federal government has a role to play in reforming police behavior, the onus is really on local departments to change their ways. ""What's he to say?"" he said when asked if President Barack Obama is doing enough to combat police violence, adding ""The Department of Justice could reduce funding to local police departments, and they haven't really done that aggressively.?

""According to our findings, fundamentally changing use of force policies can dramatically reduce the number of people killed by police in America.""

"Donald Trump ended one of the sharpest exchanges in last night's debate against Hillary Clinton with a pointed question: ""Why did she delete 33,000 emails?"" Interested in Hillary Clinton? Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Clinton is doing her best to move beyond the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, saying only last night that she ""made a mistake"" and declining to address why those emails were deleted. She didn't answer Trump's questions. However, there is an answer. The bottom line: Clinton believed the deleted emails were not work-related. In late 2014, the State Department asked Clinton and other former secretaries of state to hand over any work-related emails they may have. By then, Clinton had already ""deleted some [emails] over time as an ordinary user would,"" FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers at a July congressional hearing. And she tasked her legal team to determine which of the roughly 60,000 emails still on her server were work-related. ""Clinton told the FBI that she directed her legal team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to State; however she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her emails might exist,"" the FBI concluded in its investigative summary of the case. Comey testified that the FBI ""didn't find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice."" To determine which emails were work-related, a member ofClinton legal team did four things: she automatically deemed any email sent from or to a .gov and .mil address as related to work; she searched the tens of thousands of emails for names of senior State Department officials, lawmakers, foreign leaders and other government officials; she conducted a keyword search for work-related terms; and she looked at the sender, recipient and ""subject"" of every email for other potentially work-related emails, but she did not read the contents of those emails. In December 2014,Clinton legal team provided about 30,000 emails -- totaling 55,000 pages -- to the State Department. ""[Clinton] then was asked by her lawyers at the end, 'Do you want us to keep the personal emails?' And she said, 'I have no use for them anymore.' It's then that they issued the direction that the technical people delete them,"" Comey told lawmakers. In total, more than 30,000 emails were deleted ""because they were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy,"" Clinton told reporters in March of 2015, as the controversy around her private emails was growing. ""They had nothing to do with work,"" Clinton added. ""I didn't see any reason to keep them ... no one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy."" Clinton said her team ""went through a thorough process"" to identify work-related emails, and she said he had ""absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department."" However, after a year-long investigation, the FBI recovered more than 17,000 emails that had been deleted or otherwise not turned over to the State Department, and many of them were work-related, the FBI has said. Republican critics have accused Clinton of using a private server and ultimately deleting emails to skirt federal records laws aimed at promoting transparency, and earlier this month the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said, ""The sequence of events leading up to the destruction of SecretaryClinton emails ... raises questions about whether Secretary Clinton, acting through her attorneys, instructed [aides and others] to destroy records relevant to"" a Congressional investigation of the deadly Benghazi attack. At the July hearing before Chaffetz's committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked Comey, ""Did Secretary Clinton know her legal team deleted those emails that they kept from [Congress]?"" ""I don't believe so,"" Comey responded. During Monday night's debate, Trump promised to release his tax returns ""when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted,"" adding that he would ""go against"" the advice of his lawyers ""if she releases her emails."" Moderator Lester Holt then asked Trump if that meant releasing his tax returns was negotiable. Trump responded: ""It's not negotiable. No, let her release her emails. Why did she delete 33,000 emails?""",0.032374101,0.003597122,0.005395683,0.010791367,0.073741007,0.214028777,0,2,-1,1
"The ?designated survivor? has long been one ofWashington favorite parlorgames what America would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a State of the Union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. What would America have looked like under President Jeh Johnson (2016)? President Ernest Moniz (2014)? Or even President Alberto Gonzales (2007)? And then there are the weirder examples: In 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, Americans expecting Republican President George W. Bush might have instead found themselves with a Democratic president named Larry Summers. The idea is startling enough to fuel a new Kiefer Sutherland TV drama, Designated Survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless Housing and Urban Development Secretary who finds himself ushered into the White House after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol. Story Continued Below You might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science.That the scenario that Hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: Sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the White House by an efficient set of government minders. But in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the momentit pressed into action.I spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on thegovernment doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. The system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. As legal scholar Akhil Amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told Congress during one hearing after 9/11, ?The current Presidential succession Act, 3 U.S.C. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. It should be repealed and replaced.? Indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare Washington storythat evenstranger contains even more unexpectedtwists the Hollywood version. For one thing, the system, known as ?continuity of government,? is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. While attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. During PresidentObama inauguration in 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates was the designated presidential successor, JamesClapper the undersecretary of defense forintelligence out the swearing-in at thePentagon secret Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania known as Raven Rock, ready to step into Gates? role as defense secretary if the need arose. But the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. In fact, had Gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on January 20, 2009, itmight only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency. *** For about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. That moment in thespotlight, more accurately, far from thespotlight be brief. The night in 1997 Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served as the ?designated survivor? during one of PresidentClinton addresses to Congress, Glickman went to New York for the night, with a security detail and thenation nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech wasfinished the need for a successorover security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home. The idea of a ?designated survivor? was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations, as White House officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard Soviet submarines that lay off the Atlantic Coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutes? notice. PresidentCarter White House Military Office in April 1980 had instituted new procedures with FEMA to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors ?at major, publicly announced functions outside the White House complex.? While such gatherings of the U.S. leadership had been commonplace in thepast inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and thelike rising tensions of the Cold War made government planners questions their wisdom. ?The situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,? the White House Military Office wrote, outlining the new procedures. The 25thAmendment a modern relic of the Cold War and fears of nuclearattack out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. It flows from the vice president to the House speaker to the Senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments werecreated quirk that itself makes the Department of Homeland Security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line. When all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, FEMA was to notify the White House and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (Constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current Interior Secretary SallyJewell Brit!?don?t serve in the line of succession.) It falls to a little-known branch of FEMA, the Central Locator Service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was. The new White House and FEMA procedures got their first test atReagan inaugural. The incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed thatCarter outgoing defense secretary, Harold Brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. ?Both sides agreed that something should be done,? a FEMA official explained later. Brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the Reagan team was firmly in control ofgovernment levers. The ?designated survivor? program would grow more formal in the years tocome chosen Cabinet member would receive a Secret Service detail for the length of the event and a White House military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the ?Football,? which contain instructions on how to access thenation nuclear weaponscodes case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack. The ?designated survivor? program, though, raised a new problem: How would the ?designated survivor? prove he or she was actually now the president? The government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check thatperson identity after a decapitation event. Is the person at the other end of the phone really Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (State of the Union 2012)? ?One of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,?Reagan first FEMA head Louis Giuffrida said in 1981. ?If a successor got on the horn and said, ?I?m the successor,? and somebody said ?Prove it,? [no one could]. Sowe working on that, and FEMA will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ?Yeah, thisguy for real. Thepresident gone and wedon know where the vice presidentis this is the man.?? In the years ahead, FEMA and the White House worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the ?designated survivors? became a common part of Washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 State of the Union from the White House and ordered pizza. ?I took my staff with me and I ordered pizza for them in the Roosevelt Room,? she said years later. ?I went to the Oval Office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then I got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.? Yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining thenation succession planning found thatoddtroubling persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that KieferSutherland character, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, experiences in the TV show. As clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. And it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only ?incapacitated,? rather than killed outright.It not entirely clear, even, that the House speaker or the Senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. Republican Senator John Coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem ascended to thepresidency then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislatorsdidn count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. ?Believe it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,? Cornyn said. No less an authority than James Madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. As Cornyn said, ?Who is the president? Whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? If law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? How long will they take to rule? How will they rule? And how will their rulings be respected?? In the years after 9/11, the so-called ?Continuity of Government Commission,? pushed by American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein, who has assumed the role ofWashington succession Cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25thAmendment ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in COGoperations.It a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the ?supplantation clause,? which held that a ?prior-entitled? presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level Cabinet official who was serving as ?acting president.? For instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as ?acting president? until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. But the ?supplantation clause? inserted unhelpful ambiguity: Could, after Congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of ?acting president?? Could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? Might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties? The Continuity of Government Commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: Even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the White House and the Capitol. ?In the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,? thecommission executive director, John Fortier, told Congress during one hearing. ?Imagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.? It would be the chaos of AlHaig ?I?m in control here? statement during the Reagan administration writ larger and more fraught. One proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a ?First Secretary,? a Cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of Washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. It would be a job, in essence, to remain in an ?undisclosed location? until the worst moment of American history. * * * Such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. The terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on January 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by theSenate usuallydoesn happen for hours or even days after an inauguration. In 2001, as Fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted George W.Bush inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until Congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would bumpout the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. Fortier said, ?A country expecting Republican George W. Bush to take office would have found themselves with a Democratic President Larry Summers. As secretary of the treasury, Summers was the highest-ranking Clinton Cabinet member eligible to serve as President.? In 1989, at George H.W.Bush inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: Michael Armacost, the number three official atReagan State Department, would have been elevated to president of the United States, for the outgoing secretary of state, George Shultz, and deputy secretary of state, John C. Whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. Then, with the House in Democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped Armacost and given the nation four years of Democratic rule immediately after it elected a Republican president. In fact, given that the Senate took five days to confirm James Baker as secretary of state afterBush inauguration, Armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week. Armacost went on to serve as president of the Brookings Institution and Summers went on to serve as president of Harvard University, so both men ended up with the title of ?President,?but an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or2001?s hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the American presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need. Unless KieferSutherland drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any ofthese a host ofother with presidential succession. Congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like Rep. Brian Baird,there been little attention since.

"Democrats have some advice for Hillary Clinton at her first presidential debate: Let Trump be Trump. DonaldTrump more tightly scripted campaign of late could backfire on him when he squares off against Clinton on Monday in Hempstead, New York, Democrats believe. Hewon be able to rely on the teleprompterhe been using of late, they say, andTrump only recent extended interview with The Washington Post showed that, left to his own devices,he apt to stumble back into controversy on issues like BarackObama birthplace. Story Continued Below ?He?s going to say some cockamamie stuff,? said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.). ?Give him the rope.? Indeed, the best strategy for Clinton, lawmakers advised, is to let Trump do most of the talking. ?Inevitably,he going to say enough dumb things to dominate the headlines,? said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). ?He?s gonna make mistakes; the question is, how big are the mistakes? AndI certain there are things she can do that would cause his mistakes to be bigger.? Clinton will have to parry when Trump comes directly at her, but a more restrained rope-a-dope strategy is preferable to an aggressive posture right out of the gate, Democratic senators said. Trump showed in the Republican debates thathe best as a counter-puncher, leveling spontaneous one-liners at his attackers that left them reeling. In one debate alone, Trump dubbed Sen. Marco Rubio a ?choke artist? and Sen. Ted Cruz a ?basket case.? Rubio notoriously jumped in the sandbox but lackedTrump talent ? if you want to call it that ? for making his zingers stick. Those moments should be instructive to Clinton, Democrats say, and serve as a warning that she should not rush into a war of words with the pioneer of put-downs. ?She has to be unafraid,? said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ?He?s a bully; hecan help himself. Idon know howhe going to use a teleprompter in a debate situation. And hecan control himself. His attention span is nonexistent.? Yet implicit inReid comments is what is expected of Trump by Democrats: very little. And low expectations could be damaging on a debate night that will set the tone for a six-week sprint toward Election Day. Though Trump has been less bombastic over the past month,he still making headlines on a daily basis, whether by suggesting thatClinton Secret Service detail be disarmed or taking credit for predicting recent terrorist attacks in New York. Given the freewheeling nature of presidential debates, Democrats hope voters will see the vintage Trumpthat been partly concealed in recent weeks. ?Expectations have been exceptionally low for Trump. I thinkthat why in large part he has gotten away with it,? said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). ?If 150 million people are suddenly glued to their TV sets ? they are going to be expecting to see the conduct of who they would want in a future president.? ?He?ll do it himself,? said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). ?There?s never been a time wherehe talked for longer than 30 seconds wherehe managed to say anything. He just says nothing.He say the same empty phrases over and over again, and I think it will become obvious after an hour and a half.? The debate performances of Clinton and Trump are the subject of much chatter among Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have watched the race tighten after a summer surge by Clinton. When Clinton last visited with Senate Democrats in July, she remarked to the room that she has gotten more advice on debates than any other topic. ?Everybody in the room laughed, because most of us had given her advice on what to do,? recounted Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).There no constituency that will benefit more from a strong Clinton performance than Democrats desperately trying to take back the Senate this fall. They probably need a healthy Clinton victory to flip a minimum of four seats needed to recapture the chamber. And Clinton needs a strong debate performance to reassert the clear upper hand in the race. ?Of courseit important;she the head of the ticket. The better she does, [the better] we do,? Reid said. ?She?s been a successful debater in the race we had with Obama. Andshe been good in the primaries with [Sen. Bernie Sanders] screaming and yelling at her all the time.? Democrats are counting on Clinton to not just wait for Trump to stumble; she also has to make an affirmative case to undecided voters, they say. That means contrasting her detailed plans for health care, the minimum wage and immigration withTrump more broad-brush stands on many issues. ?Idon think that the question is about attacking Trump at this point.It about pointing out her vision for the country,? said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). ?People vote not only on who they oppose, but they want to vote for something.? Trump bragged on Fox News this week that he has the strongesttemperament. But Democrats are betting the 90-minute showdown will reveal the opposite. ?It?s important for people to see this side of him that is very much unpresidential and out of control,? said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). ?It?s temperament, as much as anything. People want to trust that their president ? is in control.?",0.049050633,0.009493671,0.003164557,0.007911392,0.068037975,0.246835443,0.006329114,2,-1,1
" To cap off a week in which police officers shot and killed two unarmed black men, a Georgia police officer has been arrested after it was discovered that she had fabricated a story about being shot by black man. Jackson Officer Sherry Hall has been charged with ?false statements, tampering, interference with government property and a violation of oath of office.? ?After following leads and evidence, the investigation has now revealed that there is no, and never was, a suspect shooter at large in Jackson, Georgia? announced special agent Joe Wooten, who was investigating the ?case.? Hall reported that on September 13th, a black man had shot her in her bulletproof vest, but it was discovered that the entire thing ? radio call, tear in shirt, spent shell ? was all a set-up. The story is a stark reminder that the word of the police cannot always be taken at face value. When a protester was shot in the head during the Charlotte riots, the police immediately announced it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting, but multiple eyewitness reports say that it was a rubber bullet fired by riot police. A picture emerged of recently slain disabled black man Keith Lamont Scott showing a gun on the ground ? but the video released by his grieving wife shows no gun but instead shows a cop dropping his glove. A police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, was recently charged with a homicide after it was discovered he had shot and killed a black man and then planted a gun on his body to justify his murder.

"Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it. During a rally, Trump declared that ?African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape thanthey ever been in before.? The assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that Jim Crow was heaven on earth. But President Obama set Trump straight during an interview with Good Morning America at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. ?You know, I think even most 8-year-olds?ll tell you that whole slavery thingwasn very good for black people,? Obama told Robin Roberts. ?Jim Crowwasn very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future.?Here the video via ABC. President Obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. ?It?s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or becauseOprah making a lot of money or because I was elected president. You know,that not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discriminationit likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that.? As President Obama said, Donald Trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. To think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive andit almost as if Trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves.

While Iraq is nearly entirely land-locked, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that cross that country are navigable, and ISIS has been using watercraft for a variety of purposes, including transporting fighters and conducting improvised explosive attacks.\ The US-led anti-ISIS coalition provided CNN with video of a September 10 airstrike against an ISIS tactical unit aboard a boat near Bayji, Iraq. Barges, skiffs and motorized watercraft have been observed operating along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for the purpose of ferrying ISIS fighters and equipment across the rivers, Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Col. Joseph Scrocca told CNN, adding that it happens often when anti-ISIS Iraqi troops control the area's bridges. Coalition bombs have also targeted bridges used by ISIS, thereby further necessitating the terror group's reliance on boats. ""They have also been used by Daesh for waterborne improvised explosive device attacks,"" the spokesperson added, using another name for the terror group.

"House Republicans already struggling to protect their historic majority this fall are confronting a multimillion-dollar shortfall in their campaign budget ? driven partly by Freedom Caucus members and other hard-line conservatives who are boycotting theGOP campaign arm. A bloc of conservatives is refusing to transfer cash to the National Republican Congressional Committee, convinced the committee is favoring moderate candidates over hard-line conservatives. Dozens of other Republican lawmakers alsohaven paid their expected party ?dues,? including several in tough primaries or general election races who figure they need the money for themselves. Story Continued Below Several GOP sources told Politico that 3 in 10 members of the House Republican Conference are delinquent on their dues. And multiple senior Republicans said the shortfall exceeds $10 million. ?There?s a group of us who associate the NRCC with the establishment wing of the party,? said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who added that he has a ?principled objection to paying dues to the NRCC.? The Freedom Caucus member noted that a former top NRCC staffer helped outside groups unseat his friend, Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, in a Republican primary last month, and said the committee is partly to blame. (The NRCCdoesn spend money in Republican primaries and says it has no control over outside groups.) Mulvaney also sayshe still upset by ads aired against him in early 2015 by American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) allied with then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). The spots implored Mulvaney and other conservatives to end their blockade of a spending bill backed by leadership. After that, several other Freedom Caucus members stopped paying dues. ?There?s a groupthat still smarting from the fact some of our own went after us, andwe be damned ifwe going to put money back in their hands,? Mulvaney said. The dispute, which one chief of staff for a House Republican called a ?brewing war,? is another sign that the schism between the activist and establishment wings of the House GOP Conference has spread to the campaign trail. Over the summer, conservative- and establishment-aligned outside groups poured millions into primary showdowns between far-right and center-right candidates. Nowit continuing in the general election, as Republicans are struggling to head off double-digit seat losses with Donald Trump leading their ticket. The refusal by conservatives to pay has enraged some House Republicans, who say the NRCC and leadership have no control over outside groups. They also note that the NRCC helped many of the nonpaying members get elected in the first place. ?Politics is a team game and outside of the HFC, almost every member of the Republican Conference is busting his or her ass to raise money and get Republicans elected,? said one senior Republican. ?The HFC has chosen not to raise money or help get other Republicans elected, but for some reason they think they should control what the NRCC does or how it spends its money?That nuts.? While the NRCC has about $2.5 million more cash on hand than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats outraised Republicans by more than $11 million combined in July and August. A big chunk of the disparity is attributable to members not paying dues, several Republican sources said. The NRCC would not comment on the dues figures provided to Politico. It downplayed the conservative boycott, saying in a statement that ?we are always very grateful to our Conference for their commitment to ensuring we maintain and grow our historic Republican House majority.? But the problem appears to be serious enough that GOP leaders have pleaded with members several times in recent weeks to pony up. On a conference call with dozens of members the last week of August, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) urged lawmakers to donate. Walden said Republicans were getting outraised by Democrats in both big and small donations, and Ryan said he was disappointed in members whohadn paid their dues, encouraging them to work as a team. And at a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, Ryan and his top lieutenants told members they need to meet their assessments to close the fundraising gap with the Democrats. A PowerPoint presentation highlighted members who were current on dues and those whohadn paid, according to sources in the room. Multiple lawmakers and staffers also told Politico the NRCC is cracking down on members whohaven paid, even barring some from accessing committee resources or attending events until they do pay. One mid-August NRCC email to Republican chiefs of staff invited them to a reception on a rooftop terrace in downtown Washington, but only for ?chiefs of members who have completed their assessments.? The same goes with lawmakers: Country band Big & Rich headlinedNRCC second annual ?house party? last week at The Hamilton restaurant in D.C. But emails inviting lawmakers in early September noted that ?only members who are paid in full? on their dues can attend. Dues are based on ability to pay, factoring in amember committee assignments and seniority. Getting politicians to fork over their hard-raised cash is a recurring problem for the NRCC and DCCC. But the shortfall this year is especially pressing for Republicans ? and increasingly appears to be based on ideological rivalries. A former NRCC staffer defended the committee, saying ?many in the House Freedom Caucus would not be there if not for the NRCC.? The committee spent $1 million help elect Mulvaney in 2010, the person said, among other caucus memberswho benefited from thecommittee largesse. At the crux of the conservatives? boycott is a belief the NRCC is now supporting moderates who back theparty leadership against conservatives who push the party further to the right. ?When those folks are going against us ? would I support that with my money? No,? said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a Freedom Caucus member who upset Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary two years ago. Some conservatives, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have instead decided to transfer money to right-leaning candidates they personally support. If those contenders win the GOP primary, it could mean more influence for conservatives. Conservatives also suspect that leadership and the NRCC are behind outside establishment-aligned groups targeting the far right of the conference. When asked about NRCC dues, Brat saidit ?illogical for me to fund ads against myself? ? though the NRCC does not directly play in primaries. Many conservatives are still furious with AAN for the round of ads they ran in early 2015 ? though the Freedom Caucus did not take an official position on the matter. AAN told POLITICO they have spent multiple times the amount of money on positive ads for some for these same members since early 2015, including 10 times in Mulvaney's case. ?I?m not sure how you use issue advocacy ads run for one day 18 months ago as an excuse not to pay political dues,"" said Mike Shields, president of American Action Network. GOP leaders have told conservatives countless timesthey not trying to undercut them in campaigns, arguing they have no control over groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that might decide to target a conservative in a primary. Allies of leadership and the NRCC also note that one of the Freedom Caucus? strongest outside allies, the conservative Club for Growth, has actively gone after sitting lawmakers, including Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). Others Republicans have been slow to contribute becausethey afraid for themselves. Several lawmakers or top staffers for lawmakerswho faced tough primaries said the NRCCdoesn help them whenthey challenged by fellow Republicans. ?They want you to give a lot of money, but it weakens you in defending yourself in the primary, and for us, the primary is where we live and die now,? said the chief of staff for one member who no longer pays his dues. In the meantime, top House Republicans are donating millions above their dues assessments to compensate for the shortfall. Ryan, for example, has transferred nearly $30 million alone. An altar call during lastTuesday GOP conference meeting, for example, brought more than $3 million, including $1.5 million from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, $500,000 from House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, $250,000 from Budget Chairman Tom Price of Georgia and $200,000 from Walden, sources in the room say.

"Story highlights Jeh Johnson spoke to senators at a hearing Tuesday Cyber threats have raised questions about Election Day Washington (CNN) Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a Senate hearing Tuesday that 18 states have taken up his agency's offer to help improve cyber security for their election systems, in the wake of suspected breaches blamed on Russian hackers. ""We are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyber intrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies. And, one or two of them have been successful, others have not,"" Johnson said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. The issue of the integrity of US elections has been a prominent one on the presidential campaign trail, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Harry Reid each raising concerns about possible rigging of the results. Both Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, said at Monday's debate that they would respect the election results. Asked by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, whether hackers are seeking to change votes, Johnson said: ""What we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters, things of that nature, not to change a ballot count."" Johnson said the matter was still an active investigation and that the source of the intrusions hadn't been concluded.

"Bullets and bodies were flying in Vegas the night of the worst American mass shooting. Blood everywhere. A hotel room with a dead shooter. Two broken windows. Anarmory worth of weapons. A Saudi Crown Prince upstairs. A girlfriend who flew the coup. Nothing adds up to give anyone answers about that horrible shooting in Las Vegas that pinned Stephen Paddock as the lone-wolf shooter responsible for hundreds of deaths and injuries. A mass shooting so bad that one must wonder how one person was able to take out so many unsuspecting concert goers. It makes you wonder if there was more than one shooter. What about that security guard who went missing? What about the rumors that people shot at a tower hoping for an explosion? Was Stephen Paddock the shooter at all? Was his girlfriend Marilou Danley involved? Was she running around outside warning people about something? New evidence leaks from Vegas that has possible crucial information that might lead to more answers the public so desperately seeks. Authorities identified her fingerprints on the ammunition, and her casino card was in the hotel room. That leads people to wonder about her involvement in the crime. Was she ever in that dreaded hotel room? Was the ammo handled at another location? Did Paddock bring her card to throw her under the bus? What part did Danley play in the atrocious shooting? Or was she a patsy? Was Paddock a patsy? Half of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting were not given an autopsy. Why? Trajectory. Number of bullet wounds. Apparently our dead lone shooter Paddock had an over 80% headshot rate. Manliker Carcano No marksman has ever reenacted Dealey successfully with one. ? Bill Chapman Fmr Film Biz Now Truth Seeker (@bchapman151) January 12, 2018 Some investigators crawled throughDanley social media and email accounts. Stephen Paddock reportedly had access to at least one of the accounts in question. More information comes out and maybe one day we can piece this horrible puzzle together. LA Times reports: ?Marilou Danley may not have been present when Paddock unleashed a furious barrage of bullets down on a crowd of 20,000 at a Las Vegas country music festival, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others, but her links to his life seemed to be everywhere. The facts about Danley were among the details revealed when a U.S. District Court judge in Las Vegas unsealed more than 300 pages of search warrants and affidavits at the request of several media outlets, including the Los Angeles Times. The request was unopposed by prosecutors. But why the 64-year-old Paddock shot up the Route 91 Harvest festival on Oct. 1 remains a mystery, and the search warrants ? despite revealing his large cache of weaponry ? raise more questions than answers about his actions and motive. Paddock came to Las Vegas with an arsenal ? more than 20 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition and spent casings were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Other search warrants revealed more than 1,000 rounds and 100 pounds of explosive material in his car. Authorities also recovered 18 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds atPaddock house in Mesquite, Nev. A ?large quantity of firearms? was recovered from another residence he had in Reno. The search warrants also covered electronic accounts and social media accounts of Paddock and Danley. They revealed an exchange about a money wire transfer. Danley returned from a trip to the Philippines days after the shooting, butwasn arrested when she arrived in the United States. According to an affidavit, Danley was identified early on ?as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack.? In the court documents, she told investigators she occasionally participated in the loading of the magazines.? Danley loaded magazines on weapons that may have been responsible for a mass amount of bloodshed. Authorities have not arrested her yet, but Danley is a person of interest. My theory is that the authorities are keeping a watchful eye on her to see what she does, who she talks to, and if any of her activity leads people to a much more significant arrest. What was Paddock doing with all those guns in one location? Hecan possibly shoot them all at once, nor would he survive a gunfight with police long enough to use all the ammunition. What were the weapons really for? What wasPaddock real story? Was he a gun runner on a deal that went bad? Was he shot before the shooting started? What happened during that concert in Vegas that set the stage for the horrible shooting?

He objected to 17 of the bills, blocking them from being passed by a simple voice vote Tuesday evening.

Republicans, including some of his own friends, have noted thathe become something of a loose canon since returning to Washington after being defeated in his primary in August. ?So much for all of Mr.Huelskamp rhetoric about the need for lame duck members to go quietly into the night,? said one GOP official.

He sat in the back row of the House chamber, avoiding the C-SPAN cameras but asking for roll calls on bills. Usually lawmakers go down to the desk ? in full view of the cameras ? to request the yeas and nays. Meanwhile, around the capitol, one of the biggest questions driving Tuesday chatter was whether he would force the IRS impeachment issue later this week.",0.017291066,0.011527378,0.005763689,0.014409222,0.040345821,0.296829971,0.002881844,2,-1,1
"Sen. ChuckSchumer money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover Chuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And nowhe starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader. The New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats? campaign arm on Tuesday.He also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said. Story Continued Below Earlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls. Republicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way. ?The Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,? said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. ?We?re just trying to allocate our resources sothey meaningful to us and our candidates.?Schumer money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.Schumer donation is both a vote of confidence in hisparty candidates and a reflection of Democrats? future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade. Schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates? committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates.He planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidatesthat projected to bring in ?upwards of another million,? according to a person close to the New York senator. ?Schumer has been relentless,? said a DSCC official. Schumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them. ?Leader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,? McCue said in a statement. Schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition. Schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats.Schumer colleagueswon rule out the possibility thathe donate more to hisparty Senate takeover effort. ?If he thinks it will make a difference,he do it.He very calculating,? said a Democratic senator. ?Chuck will be there if you need him.? Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more. ?He?s going to watch everything closely.It my sensehe 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,? Stabenow said.There no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option. ?We?re going to make some tough decisions, whichhaven been made yet,? Reid said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune saidhe need to hang on to the rest of his cash. ?Idon think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,? Thune said in an interview. Republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning. Republicans, however, simplydon have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win. ?He?s a machine,? Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But ?it may not make a difference,? the Texan added.",0.028050491,0.001402525,0.001402525,0.01542777,0.040673212,0.239831697,0.007012623,2,-1,1
"Rebecca Francis, winner of the reality television show ""Extreme Huntress,"" has been receiving death threats for pictures that she has posted to social media. The photos show her posing next to animals that she has killed while hunting. Metro reported that the Utah native has killed bears, moose, zebras and antelopes during her hunting career. She recently posed with a big smile next to a dead giraffe and posted it to Facebook. Many social media users reacted negatively; some even said that they wished the hunter was dead. Twitter user @AsapGinger1 wrote, ?I know this is very hypocritical of me but I want to f****** shoot her just for this picture.? Actor Ricky Gervais is also an animal rights supporter and tweeted the photo of Francis next to the dead giraffe. His message was retweeted more than 17,000 times. According to the Independent, Francis has eight children. However, multiple pregnancies and babies have not prevented her from hunting in the United States and Africa. ?We hunt elk and deer every year without fail, even through pregnancy, and nursing babies. Our hunting trips are self-guided,? she said. Francis has also hosted the television show ""Eye of the Hunter."" She claims to have killed a wide range of animals, including, ?A 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose, dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel.?

"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops ?are just obeying orders,? and the dead in the mass grave are ?citizens obeying gun laws.? This is the meme: Wedon know who created this, but wedon have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaustwouldn have happened. The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as theEinsatzgr. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decidedweren suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way ? they are part of the Holocaust. The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actuallydidn make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to. Whydidn those people, who could own guns, rise up?It because of the power of a police state ? the very thing the ?moar gunz? crowd fears the most. Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, they have no problem whatsoever with using the horror of the Holocaust to further their ?all guns all the time? agenda. That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all.Here why: ?This historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians have previously noted, a distortion of history itself? ?When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.?That from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against BenCarson painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, butit just not true. Andit an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. Thismeme creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out.
